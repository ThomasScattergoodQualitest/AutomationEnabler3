Using HubSpot to track all your sales & customer emails is fantastic. Records get updated and you have a great information about your communications. The one major major issue is that you have to be really careful about tracking emails because you can end up with a pile of contacts in HubSpot that shouldn't be there. And worse you can end up with legal investor and other emails & documentation inside HubSpot for others to see. HubSpot needs to make it easier to filter out contacts that you don't want to track. It is possible to do this it just isn't easy.,2,Nov 29 2021,0.6658333333333333,0.13333333333333336

"This review is specifically for Gmail integration with SalesHub and not HubSpot overall. My work is done primarily within Gmail and you are not auto-alerted within Gmail in a user-friendly way. You have ""open"" SalesHub to see a list of relevant activities/opens/clicks etc.. instead of being able to see them in Gmail. Also the reporting features are very limited and you cannot ""batch enroll"" a list of leads/contacts. SalesHub caps at 50 contacts -- not very efficient... Compared to MixMax and SalesLoft -- SalesHub significantly falls short of being a sales-centric tool.",1,Oct 20 2021,0.465079365079365,0.16468253968253968

It often is a company process to ensure everyone is making their correspondence visible to the rest of the company. In previous years most CRMs would allow this by bcc'ing a set address. This wasn't ideal  people forget these rules so the gmail integration makes this foolproof,5,Sep 7 2021,0.5555555555555555,0.41111111111111115

Google Workspaces works just fine. But I don't like the HubSpot integration all that well because I feel that it relies on too much additional plugins. For example if I want good email tracking I have to use a Chrome extension to get the job done or send all emails from within HubSpot. Otherwise I have to manually BCC my HubSpot address each time. That is not the ideal solution for me because I prefer using Firefox and I don't want to have two tabs open for redundancy. Furthermore I do not receive all mail in HubSpot. Let me actually integrate HubSpot with Gmail without jumping through so many hoops.,3,Sep 2 2021,0.4857142857142857,0.3880952380952381

"The best I can say is that it's minimally functional. Essentially consider it mostly a ""view only"" window into HubSpot which has clearly decided it wants you to ""live in"" the HubSpot web app all day rather than work out of Gmail. For context we migrated from Copper CRM to take advantage of HubSpot's complete suite--CRM sales hub marketing hub customer service hub etc. Copper can't match the functionality of having everything in one place. That said it's shocking to me that a vastly smaller company by comparison could be light years beyond HubSpot when it comes to Gmail integration. Our sales team has always worked out of the inbox. Copper allowed them to do that because there wasn't any day-to-day deal/opp management functionality that existed in the web app that didn't exist in the Chrome extension. This allowed our sales team to quickly and easily manage every aspect of a related contact company and deal/opp record without ever leaving Gmail. It was such a good experience that I simply presumed a company of HubSpot's size and cost would be at least as good if not better. I was wrong.",2,Jul 21 2021,0.5397186147186148,0.11150137741046832

I like being integrated. What I don't like is the HubSpot ribbon on the side taking up so much space. It forces me to scroll EVERY email I get greatly reducing my positivity about HubSpot. If that could be smaller/eliminated etc - I'd feel better about HubSpot. If I'm forced to chose one or the other - HubSpot will not win.,2 ,Jun 16 2021

Gmail is great the HubSpot integration needs some sharpening up. The sidebar popup to add new contacts to HubSpot pops up far too regularly. Whenever any email is clicked on the HubSpot sidebar appears unnecessarily which is irritating.,2 ,Jun 15 2021

Great tool allowing email correspondence with easy search feature. Mails can be easily sorted.,4 ,Jun 15 2021
Gmail is excellent. The HubSpot sidebar that opens with every message and cannot be persistently closed (kept closed) ruins the UX and robs users of 15-25% of available screen space. Unfortunately we have to keep the plugin installed for tracking/logging but I use an ad blocker to block the panel so all I get is a big waste of white space.,2 ,Jun 14 2021
All the features just work. Moving from Office365 it was not clear where everything was however once I was able to identify all functionality it has been seamless.,4 ,Jun 14 2021

HubSpot integrated with Gmail is exceptional - because all the same messaging templates and snippets stored in HubSpot are one-click accessible to pull into your Gmail messaging. And having HubSpot Log 'n Track all my Emails and activities to each of my contacts - no more searches trying to find my last emails to particular contacts - I just click the Contact in HubSpot and it organizes and stores all my Gmail activity in my Contacts account.

It's a decent integration and the sidebar panel for clients is nice when you're viewing an email. The tracking/log controls are easy and the snippet/template stuff is great - we use it often. But coming from Insightly the one BIG omission is a simple click to save against a HubSpot record. Insightly allowed you to click 'save' and search for a contact opportunity project etc and save the email against it. HubSpot still requires the 'forward to an email' thing and doesn't really let you choose how it's saved.,4,Jun 2 2021,0.5581632653061225,0.31428571428571433

I only use Gmail outside of HubSpot. There are pros and cons. My Gmail is integrated with HubSpot but I do not use it. I am a true startup and Army of one. There are too many limitations using Gmail through HubSpot. HubSpot wants to brand all of my emails with HubSpot logo and links. It make my emails look cheap....which is not helpful to a startup.,1,Jun 1 2021,0.4600000000000001,0.21000000000000002
Very Poor. When sending email Campaigns it only recognises one email not the bulk 100. When targetting thousands of customers this needs to be recorded.

I have 3 different businesses that all use Gmail and I figured that since I have each one connected (in HubSpot) to a HubSpot account using that email address that it wouldn't send email from one account to another but it does. It doesn't matter what account you link in HubSpot if you are logged in to a specific HubSpot account (which it forces when you are in Gmail) then all other Gmail accounts open that have the plugin will send emails to that HubSpot account.

1) I would like HubSpot to retire the legacy Chrome Extension in favor of a Google G-Suite Gmail Addon. The extension sits on top of the native UI overlaying other components and never works quite right frequently causing issues when trying to send messages through Gmail. 2) When you publish the addon please make sure it has the ability to create tickets. One use-case for this would be to click on a HubSpot addon in Gmail to forward messages that were sent to individual address (instead of the support address) and this functionality would allow us to create a ticket on behalf of the original sender.,3,Sep 26 2020,0.535657596371882,0.2336734693877551

Gmail seems to work well. HubSpot email tracking doesn't work that well. email tracking within HubSpot is atrocious as it doesn't handle contacts tied to multiple deals. it simply guesses and is a huge time suck to clean up deals that have multiple contacts or contacts with multiple deals associated with him/her.

Working fine but HubSpot integration is very intermittent. Sometimes works mostly not. Also the way HubSpot displays email threads is so annoying it’s almost a showstopper. You click on an email to some more and it leaps off in an entirely disorienting way somehow positioning the thread upside down so you have no idea what order to read anything in. It sucks,2,Jul 13 2020,0.4892361111111111,-0.04861111111111112
