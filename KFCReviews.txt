worst customer service in the food industry. no way to cancel orders on the app. no one to answer phones with customer service. employees are lazy and won't cook food. I will never go to another kfc

place is a dump every location. they overstuffed a drive thru bag with an uncapped gravy that ended up exploding the bag and spilling on his lap and burning his leg and hands and because he said the f word one time the manager kicked him out. absolute cess pit I'll never visit another KFC as long as I live. me or my 7 family members that visited weekly.

Do not ever go to the Sebastian Florida location!!!! Gone there twice in the past two months. First time was told they didn’t have enough workers so they wouldn’t take my order and tonight I placed an order on the app for $50 and when I got there said they had no chicken or any KFC items only Taco Bell. Now I get to wait 3 days and pray I get my refund.

Went to KFC on 521 ordered a 16 and they packed burnt chicken on top of the fresh chicken. Ordered two half gallon sweet teas and received one sweet one unsweetened like ugh called the store and the manager had an attitude so I hung up wasn’t in the mood to argue or listen to her staff lie in the background.

Absolutely the worst place in Batesville to eat! Half the time they don't even have what's on the menu! They close early open late and only offer parts of the menu! And when you pay for a pick up and arrive to pick it up the doors are locked and they won't answer. You call no answer! I will not be eating here ever again!

This is what I got in my wings and threw the whole $50 order in the garbage bc everything is fried together! Will never go back after this. I posted to messenger and they didn’t respond. I posted to their site and no response. I posted everywhere you can connect with KFC and not a word!

Well the food I received yesterday looked & taste funny! I didn’t taste the chicken It looked like they refried It 10 times. The fries tasted like they were fried In a toilet bowl. Tenders were hard as hell. I feed this to a dog! It was soooo nasty. I didn’t eat It. Garbage and waste of money!

Last night my family ordered KFC for dinner. Half of our meal was missing when we got home. We tried to call but after 8-10 phone calls we still did not receive an answer. It is absolutely unacceptable.

KFC in my town is awful. They don’t put the order in right won’t take incorrect drinks back and won’t make the order right either. I paid $20 and only got half the food I was supposed to. I doubt I ever get a refund but I can promise I never go back and tell everyone I know how bad this company is.

This review is for the Main Street location in Lexington NC
I ordered the 8 piece tenders with sides.
Service was fine but the chicken tenders were barley warm dry and rubbery.
The other sides were fine.
Too much money for chicken that bad.

I spent $50 on food only to get home with items missing wrong kind of chicken and was greasy/slimy! There was half an inch of grease in the bottom of the bucket. Now I know how to cook and know chicken is fried but come on I called KFC here in Pikeville KY and was told they would refund half my money I even asked her you are going to refund half my money? She said yes. So I’ll admit it was at least a week an a half but made the trip there ( I live about 25 min away) a...

I bought a ten piece dark chicken bucket. When we got home we took it out of the carton and it was un edible. The legs and thighs was only the size of a pigeon! They looked like they were cooked several days before they passed them off on me. We ended up throwing all of it in the garbage! This store is located at 1499 Dixwell ave Hamden Ct. Plus I was charged $19.99. This is almost double of what I pay for the same order in a store in Derby Ct. where the food is always good and fresh.

They are always out of everything. They should just take half of the stuff of the menu if they are top lazy to cook more. I AM DONE GOING TO THIS LOCATION maybe even KFC at this point. They were out of tenders wouldn't let me have full 8piece of crispy let me continue my order unhappy.. get to the window charge my card THEN say oh no macaroni sorry. They replaced it with more potatoes. So I got random chicken & potatoes for 25$. Then I just got home to no gravy with the mashed potatoes. I would have never ordered there if they told me from the beginning they had no mac no gravy and no tenders. Not to mention everything COLD. Absolutely ridiculous.
