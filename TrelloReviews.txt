What is Trello?
WordPress is free open source content management service. Its features include a plugin architecture and a template system. It can support different types of media. It has thousands of customizable themes as well.  I find the Nexonia Expenses to operate at optimal and there is nothing that i have found annoying.  Realty broker Office has done an amazing job with their functionality. It can make transactions and keep their track. It links you to the market and develops more contacts.  I can not mention something bad about Canva because I have not found anything wrong, canva is excellent software that does not deserve someone to speak badly about it, it has all the win because it has excellent prices and a design in its software that gives a comfort to very successful user.  It is amazing in functioning and its features are good so I like the way it works.  The only problem that I find this Microsoft is that it does not save the information we are doing is a problem because if your device has a fault you could delete the information, I like this application a lot because of the ease it gives us in doing our documents either legal or personal.   UI is not the most intuitive, and it is outdated.   pretty much the standard package installer/update for python. It does its job very well.most of the main libraries can be downloaded and installer through pip.  nulla, dispone di una installazione intuitiva.  I like the animation and how easy it is to create a presentation. It's very intuitive and easy to use. You don't need to read a tutorial or anything to understand how it works. I also like how easy it is to share a link with someone.  The delays in the business ideas and the processing since there is congestion in the system.  However, on file following, which is a major concern for filtering and searching requires some improvements, and this will save on time completely.   It is capable of performing at the highest level possible. It can do everything you desire of email validation and verification tool. I see no faults  Its easy to install and configure.Reliable for organising and holding meeting with clients.Remote support is very convinient for system support and sorting computer problems.Great with screen sharing which is very good with trainings.Free trial works well.  There's not much I dislike as they are constantly listening to the field and updating their system to support our needs.  This is an extension that should definitely be provided for free, instead of having a premium version. The trial period of 14 days is also too short I think. Technically speaking, I have found no issues with the actual software.   Nothing to disdain, now and then keeping it basic and restricted is the most ideal approach to learn.  I have not had any issues with this platform everything has worked pretty well for me.  It is a very efficient and fast application to make changes at any time without inconveniences, it has great flexibility and ease of use with great multifunctional software.  Trabajar con API RESTful externa simplemente con el proveedor y no debe tratar con los requisitos locales de cada plataforma. Todo simplemente funciona. Tienen muchos equipos e imágenes en movimiento disponibles. La verdad que puedo escribir una vez y correr a cualquier parte. Ionic 1  The framework is planned on a standard based methodology, be that as it may, we should can get in some innovation that can be founded on self learning on the aftermaths and hurl proposals that will be extraordinary.   paypal has very strict policies and non-compliance would lead to the temporary suspension of the account for a stipulated period of time  It has a simple and easy to use interface. The tools are excellent. Data unification and sharing permissions contribute to the execution of processes. The support is great, I was very well attended when I needed to ask questions.  With accurate data and in real time, intuitively and with certainty I can make adjustments, change, modify, optimize and much more all in one tool. Everything is great with this software. I have nothing that I do not like about it.  The best feature is to have e-signature fields to your forms and include fields that you manually are unable to. It is super easy to use and it is very easy to generate forms out of your current pdfs. It saves a lot of time and is very user friendly.   PgAdmin is a very light and easy to use client for PostgreSQL DBMS. The versions lower than 4 are desktop applications, while since version 4 PgAdmin became a web application. My collegues prefer the desktop version while I use the web versione without problems.  No complaints with the platform although sometimes it may hang and refuse to send emails.  what I like most about confluence is that I can use many of its features. One of the features I like most is that I can create notepads with several notes and share with my work friends, and they can create notes and share with me, confluence has a interface is also very easy to use and install.  Muchas veces es muy lenta de cargar y esto es muy molesto.  It is easy to compose and edit and format because it have a good user interface.It works well since it removes all the dirty texts within the doucment.I prefer working with it since i don't need to edit it again when uploading the formatted doucment.  I have nothing bad to say about ENOVIA since it's effective  With Act programming, you can't see portion bits of knowledge in regards to each record and resolve past due sales. It is hard to do customer orders objectives with that. Furthermore Act could be moderate and you can just investigate from 1 to 1 account and can't treat different records meanwhile.  i do not have anything to complain about Trello.  I like it since I can create emails and I can get pixel level persnance in all aspects of my email.  The faculties that are mentioned in this tool allow to hinder any attempt of interruption in the information load with other technological platforms. Each particular action requires a robust knowledge of the process.   It requires some expertise to be able to setup the software and configuring which is a complex process.  En realidad, incluso el grupo que se encuentra en la parte posterior de Play 2 es prácticamente seguro que es genial obtener Forms, Json Handling y Webservices de forma gratuita, pero no es necesario que los apliques a todos. la parte de atras del juego  Not always that the drag and the dropping feature functions since, it may cause breakdown.   So far so good have not experienced any cons but hoping it won't give me any difficulties  Mightycall is easy to use and helps one to keep track of all calls.It provides helpful customer service.  I have nothing negative against the dropbox. he is incredible.  non c'e' nulla che non mi piace perchè permette di realizzare tutto quello che mi interessa

I don't like how the archives are extremely reports every time you want to observe only a little documentation. Practically, I create a document many times when I only need to download information on 6 terms.

-Inventor LT is a nice tool and am yet to see any problem on its usage. The main drawback of the software is its presentation, which seems a bit old, it costs a lot when it is in the middle of a major operation with a user to stay focused seeing an interface so unattractive to the eye.

I love your customized module and its forms modules to reduce the hours of preparation proposed. We can extract important and centralized information for our users who have confidence in the data delivered. To fully utilize the PowerPoint a lot of tutorials are required. It has a lot of templates but I feel they are a bit outdated. Using animations in PowerPoint is a bit difficult as compared to other tools having the same purpose. We use this to run all of our SQL processes on a daily basis. We save HOURS of work by automating everything through here.

Sometimes it crashes and stops working when opening some PDF documents. Some PDF Documents are unable to open and when we try multiple times then application cursed and its stop working.
What do you like best?
It is easy to use.Easy to create tables.Accuracy. Ease of installation.Ability to create impressive contents. not always clear targeting options. Some criteria for sorting are also missing. But I hope in the future all this will appear and the platform will take the first place on the market. I see no major setback about this system to put across for sure. nulla, dispone di una installazione intuitiva. What I like the most about microsoft onedrive for bussines is that I can send many files in a single time and save them, I like it too because I can download these files whenever I want, I like to keep them safe oneded, I like it too because it has a lot of space for me to use, it is incredible. I do not like skype that for people in areas with low quality connection has many interruptions, I think there should be a system to lower the quality or place an image and only listen to the audio for those who do not have a good connection.

The survey is executed online and in case one of the respondents is in a remote area, the execution of the survey will be impeded and not succeed The only thing I disliked it that we didn't start early! This is everything we have been looking for wrapped up in a cheap package!

What problems are you solving with the product? What benefits have you realized?
you must have a good connection to the internet, because if your connection is scant, the videos are probably not as defined With this product, I see all the traffic of our advertising sites and based on them I can make further plans.This product is the simplest to use. I also like the StackAdapt support team, they always listen to their customers and sometimes even implement our requests.

paypal one of the most used digital wallets in the world, you can send money to users easily and quickly, you can make purchases or cancel services, has different tools which will make the sending or collection of money faster and easier the best is the github because it is free and contains open codes, it is fabulous I do not have anything bad to limit I did not find disadvantages while using it but sometimes it delays in printing invoices but its functionality is generally good. If used over the long-term, customers may get used to the effect Too much promotion may damage the brand image.Risk of losing control - cannot always control what other people write or say about your product. Chrome is a browser that Google offers. This interface offers the most intelligent integrated tools on the web, which makes it easier to concentrate on what interests you. I've experienced a few issues in the past that have affected business however these are quickly resolved by the support team.

effective in scheduling of appointments reliable in medical billing and revenue collectionbest healthcare management system The program may cause difficulties for new users. I don't complain in any way regarding openElement.. A happy user, who is extremely positive about the software capability. Rational DOORS makes it easy for everyone in our organisation and beyond to participate in and contribute to the requirements management process in a number of formats. I am having problem in using visa card. The sometimes deny your payment. One more thing I didlike about Zomato is that many of its restaurants do not accept orders at a particular time.

the collaboration features it has are really good, it seems to me of great advantage that the hardware requirements are very modest so you can use the old hardware that you have in the company and thus save costs
What do you like best?
Jostle hasn't got many bells and whistles and I'm actually not too happy regarding the notifcation system. It doesn't send out an alert but rather an email that looks like spam. I was refused to be paid for medical bills with all the paperwork in place. They come up with random reaasons or just stall to avoid making payments The design of the platform has no appeal SalesaGlobe is an Innovative company that provides a wide range of sales effectiveness services; concentrating on sales transformation, sales compensation and sales operations management.

What do you like best?
I don't take care of that it charges pine State per dealing...but I comprehend why they're doing it. It makes wholly totally different frameworks like Venmo further collaborating. The free version is not really useful it should offer at least double storage space if any commercial entity is to use it. Conflict resolution in same files could be handled better, this is just my point of view some may differ.

nulla, questo software e' perfetto cosi com'e' anche nella sua versione server soddisfa le mie esigenze. Reliable for sharing files with the team.Helps alot with project management thus very efficient.Instant messaging which helps with faster response.Intergration is easy with other applications Security problems is a retardant if you do not take a correct care and such troubleshoots would possibly influence be pricey. Sometimes I have to wait longer than usual for the connection and sometimes the signal drops and I stay in the air,as a result of this my investigations are delayed and I lose a lot of time of the day. Easy to use and very modern software.I like how it intergrate with CAD tools such as AutoCAD

Definitely what I like least about Sketch is that it is only compatible with the Mac operating system, that creates multiple difficulties for other users to access it, if we take into account that the majority of the population uses Windows, leaving that aside It is an incredible platform.
What do you like best?
There is nothing wrong with gmail it is very good. like so much. Some of our staff encountered a steep learning curve in understanding how to use the platform efficiently. there is nothing negative on skype I really like it. I like everything that Skype offers but there is something that if it is very annoying when I use Skype, I do not like the spawn messaging, they send advertising that is not to my liking. emailable.io is an amazing email verification tool. It does much more than just email verification. It is simply great. We have no regrets or complaints

What I dislike about this informatic product is only one thing and that is that sometimes, the options in which you must convert images to PDF or backwards are somewhat slow and require time to load and carry out the process, for everything else there is But nothing that upsets me.

Getting it is somewhat expensive and is only available for iPad or Mac. Netbeans could be a little dificult if you never done any coding and never user any coding tool.I think that Netbeans should have some more easy tool to beutify the code, for now it doesn't have (that i've founded). The software gets stuck at sometimes but not always! other than that, I see no drawbacks.

Exact writing, analysis of the whole group, breakdowns by skills but simple to investigate the calls and observe the context.
What do you like best?
Sometimes the user interface is buggy depending on the version of windows you have. This software so far has been amazing, and I am hard-pressed to find any flaws with it other than the UI I can add contacts, issue invoices and do analysis very easily. It is quite safe to add data. I really like the efficiency of zabbix in monitoring all our customers' internet circuits. There's is no reward of converting the points into mobile money. The application requires internet so as to open on any device thus it's not possible to use incase there's no connectivity. Its already has all my friends there promotion Even without tutorials, one can comfortably learn how to use the application.Secondly, this software has all the fonts size and colors that a person requires. Installation takes a little time. And finally, the program has an inbuilt spell checker. The box requires alot of internet connection to work efficiently.

Not well Marketed in West Africa. Marketing should be improved I love how deeply integrated the workflow environment is, and the user interface is highly intuitive.

It offers a lot of plug-ins and languages support in case if the developer is interested in using more than one language in the project, it’s very easy to navigate among them. Good developer support, they are responsive to queries made. It is the simplest technology to use however one factor that bothers is that it must offer Associate in Nursing up to this point version for windows ten.

I like it because i can manage my personal,blog twitter account from a single page and it's a great tool to monitor all my twitter activity and reply mention easily Ratings suggest it all,,, I like everything about SEOmonitor if i have to say. The idea of a distributed repository unlike SVN attracts the most. Easy to use via plugins in Eclipse IDE. GUI is user friendly. Approve commits feature is popular and helps in maintaining stable code base. It is not so intuitive for people with less experience. However, with a little patience, we have managed to train all the collaborators and we are steadily progressing faster and faster.

No dislikes.

I like the remote feature of Microsoft office it boosts up the productivity. As this works on cloud based system so we can access our files everywhere. It comes with a very clean user interface which also helps in the productivity. This software provide a better platform for video conferencing for personal and professional both. We can share our data data and file easily and safely.with anyone. Here, we can also share screen. There is nothing that I despise about YouiDraw Painter. It resembles the free paint program from Windows of days gone by. The mobile application has an intuitive user interface that enables sales team to supplement their presentations and create data visualization tools consequently. It can be difficult to extract information from pdf which have a lot of image file. Other than that, it is a great library.

The program may be limited to very professional users. It lacks more advanced functions, but it is normal since it is a free program.

What do you dislike?
I like the fact that Samepage has tons of features in one secure platform.Availability of mobile application is another thing that I like most about Samepage.It is easy to sign up and start using Samepage. Not always that the drag and the dropping feature functions since, it may cause breakdown. In my experience, I have not found anything to dislike about the software. It is very helpful to me and easy to use. -Inventor LT is a nice tool and am yet to see any problem on its usage. Utilizo Xfce Desktop Environment con mi dispositivo Ubuntu Linux en mi Chromebook. Las capacidades excepcionales de XFCE incluyen portabilidad e integridad. Puede hacer todas las cosas que pueden hacer Unity, Gnome o KDE, pero es una búsqueda de limpiadores más rápida y rápida.

This software has made the process of customer service more fluid, reaching goals in less time, until now, and it has not had any problem in using it.
What do you like best?
This system makes it easy for communication within the hospital as well as patients and resource tracking. Super comfortable with Mercury Editor and the challenges that hardly arise can be well sorted by the support group.. The page tends to be saturated when I start working on any of the existing modules. It takes a lot of verification of two factors. deliver exceptional value to clients help them achieve their goal .it also save time With BrainLeaf, we get everything we pay for. There is no dissatisfaction whatsoever. We are completely satisfied with its performance TinyMCE has an intuitive and user-friendly Graphical User Interface that makes it easy to operate.It is easy to set up and highly customizable.TinyMCE has many excellent editing tools and premium features.It has cool plugins that are simple to configure. some functionalities may require training to work with. Customisation options are less and can be improved. Dashboard is not user friendly, counter-intuitive and takes some getting used to. Having a reviewer per person is one thing i found which should be changed. All the more its one of the best product to be used especially in management companies. Skype is very user-friendly and easy to install it on mobile devices such as phones, tablets and computers/laptops. I love how deeply integrated the workflow environment is, and the user interface is highly intuitive. The limited and hiked points used in redeeming the rewards. Efficient software with ease of payments, with the power to collect information from our customers to help the sales team, the best of all is the easy integration with social networks. Best of all, its free It has an amazing long and support lifespan, and great compatibility and support It is backed up by a professional ream at RedHat and it has a high lifespan. It is easy to install and solid

What do you dislike?
The LiveAgent does not support the messages archiving which i guess the team should work on. Only a few functions are difficult to find otherwise if you are well aware of the software, you can use it smoothly. I don't like how the archives are extremely reports every time you want to observe only a little documentation. Practically, I create a document many times when I only need to download information on 6 terms.

What do you dislike?
The established schemes to edit avant-garde web designs is what I like about this tool. In the organization we use it to manage a significant number of personnel that can access or download their inventory reports and handle a priori what concerns their activities. weebly offer great tools for website building for developing having little exposure of the field. The drag and drop feature is quite helpful. It has a lot of customizable themes which are one the best in the market.It also allows the user to edit using html or CSS.

Theirs no much dislike about this software though their is no version for iOS.
What do you like best?
Uploading and self saving can be a problem, they should improve those two tools. Besides that, I have nothing else bad to say, works very well. Hasta la fecha mi experiencia con AttackFlow ha sido completamente satisfactoria, ya que con esta poderosa herramienta podemos crear aplicaciones y software mucho mas seguros y menos vulnerables a posibles ataques de piratas informáticos. I have been utilizing remote work area arrangements from such a significant number of years to get to my customers work area and setup design for programming and trust me have attempted a great deal of arrangements even contenders of Anydesk however Any work area is best out of them. -Inventor LT is a nice tool and am yet to see any problem on its usage. Medical office online should be made more cost-effective.The backups should be done every 12 hours and made available to a server that's easily accessible and secured. The secured login should include other methods of login.

For buying this software according to its features it is more costly. When any new user starts using Adobe Photoshop then they are unable to understand and use it because it is more complex.
