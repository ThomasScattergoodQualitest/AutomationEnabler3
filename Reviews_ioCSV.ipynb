So we don't know what is the balance in the account and how do we get back. There are lots of people having a similar review on Review Centte. Natwest has to somehow sort this problem out without any delay as we need our money back straightaway.\\nI complained to Natwest and gave all the details as required by them. Yesterday after checking with them about the status of my complaint. They said they have deleted it from their system and sent all the details to their CTF section, who have not bothered to contact us anyways. Somebody has to.take responsibility and sort this problem out. It is having a devastating effect on me and my child's physical and mental health.

I was then told I needed to email proof that I wanted to transfer the money (which I did whilst still on the call). 2 days later, they still hadn't released the payment and to make it worse, they had completely locked me out of my own bank account, so I could no longer access anything, never mind transfer the remaining funds. I spent more than 2 hours on old over the course of half a day and twice they hung up on me before I had even given my name and another time in the middle of a call. 5 days later and the money has still not been transferred and they will close my account on Monday and then I will have to pay extra to get the money released on top of additional administrative expectations.

She tried to pay cash in through machine, but it didn't work, meanwhile a member of staff called over from the other side of a screen, quite loudly, to pay small bundles in at a time. We gave up and went to the cashiers desk, my daughter was asked where she got the cash from, she told cashier it was a bond and the cashier asked why it wasn't paid direct into Natwest account.... Once money was paid into Natwest my daughter asked for all her money in the account to be transferred to solicitor, the cashier told her to go queue on the other side. She stood in queue for 8minutes (7months pregnant and upset to have to pay EX £30,000) Cashier no.2 arrived and asked my daughter again , where she got the cash from that was just paid in? my daughter answered and also told her she had just told cashier no.1.

      "[\"“\\nI've been a business banking customer since I started my first business in 2014. There have been multiple issues which have this month come to a head.\\nIn the time since 2014 Natwest have refused us an overdraft on all three occasions we took the time to try and apply through their convoluted system. During this time we have never had a loan, never defaulted on any payments, averaged between £20k - £48k turnover on a monthly basis (it's seasonal work) and run all of our utilities payments and PDQ machine takings and BACS payments through the account as well as operating our VAT account through Natwest. They did well from us in monthly fees and other additional transfer costs as we purchased from the US on many occasions.\\nRegardless, they seemed more than disinterested in offering us any sort of assistance in growing the business, which is disappointing and frustrating seeing as they like to promote themselves as the best bank for small businesses. I do not agree with them on this.\\nI have not once been able to talk to their small business representative, of which they have one person in the south west of the UK, at one point I was handed his mobile number after my frustrations became clear, he never returned a call, in 3 years. No one in branch (I tried in Chiswick where I opened the account, Bristol where the business operated from and Bath repeatedly) will discuss anything to do with small business bank accounts, other than letting you deposit cash or cheques, or take out cash and forgetting to assign references to transactions when requested, which may seem like a small error but is in-fact very important when book keeping and talking to HMRC. As any small business owner can attest to, keeping your book keeping as clear and informative as possible is a large step on the way to staying profitable.\\nWe ended up staying with Natwest simply because I was too busy to do otherwise and it was synced with our Xero accounting and a 7-10 delay on reconciling the account would have been a difficult task to undertake during busy months.\\nAfter the lockdown affected our business ability to operate Natwest started asking us for all sorts of documents relating to our business structure, information that we did not have to provide previously but was now of utmost importance - list of directors, photo ID of directors, home address of directors, list of people with significant control, copies of DLA signed by our accountants, declaration of beneficial ownership.... We provided all of these and offered our own questions, such as why this was now necessary, why Natwest thought they had a right to our business details as they are just the bank that holds the money we have earned and what was their purpose for wanting these details. Every one of our questions went unanswered, the communication at Natwest to discuss these matters is worse than lacking it simply does not exist.\\nThis month and without any notice or warning Natwest closed both my business current and VAT accounts, basically making it impossible for us to trade when we are legally allowed to do so again.\\nThere is no one at the end of the phone at Natwest that can offer any assistance whatsoever with this matter. An email address does not exist, so there is conveniently no dated record of correspondence, I had to resort to (and I can't quite believe this) Facebook messenger to try and make contact, I received one reply which was deeply unhelpful and actually mostly consisted of more questions than answers, it has been two hours and I have not had an answer to my response.\\nI feel let down and left out to dry by the bank that I put my trust in, under their persuasion and apparent commitment to small business development. I can tell you now that this commitment they promote is a complete fabrication and the infrastructure does not exist within Natwest to help any small business grow or even stay afloat. Natwest have done more damage to us than I ever thought possible and they refuse to even discuss any of this with me.\\nAbsolutely shocking how bad, destructive and disinterested in customer care this bank is.\\n”\", '1', ' 8 months ago']\n",

Otherwise, he would freeze my account and I wouldn't be able to pay in or withdraw my money and they would close my account if i didn't 'co-operate' !\\nThe guy was extremely rude, unpleasant and threatening.

All my funds have been withheld and are being withheld by the bank for up to 60 days. After carefully reading the bank's terms and conditions, i am 110% sure i have not broken any, definitely NOT committed any fraud (reason why bank can withhold funds for up to 60 days). After being told that my account was closed by going in branch and speaking with the account closure team a couple of times. I find out today that my account is still active and receives funds although i have no access to it or to any funds on it. I've asked for my bank statements up until the account closure so i know the exact amount i'm supposed to get back as all my salary and any kind of funds are stuck there, today after speaking with the Account closure team, i find out that i only have around 600£ out of 3183£ but why i ask, the answer being that its maybe related to the to the personal loan i have taken out and the credit card money i owe , mentioning that i have paid money in my credit card account and last time i've spoken to the closure team i have been instructed to arrange a standing order just a few days before the normal paying date on my new bank account(with another bank) to pay back the money i owe in instalments as i did until now. The bank has taken the liberty of paying off the loan and credit card apparently out of my funds without my consent and without me knowing. I cant believe this has happened and i don't see how this can be legal, it is my money and the decision to close down my account was not mine and i have not done anything wrong.

Made it clear though it was my 'choice' whether I gave them anything, but if I didn't they might consider closing my account.\\nTo send anything though, well they failed to provide any address to send anything to when I specifically requested it, said it would come in an email which it didn't, instead I got a useless email asking me to contact them again, and then when I did we went into the death spiral of them again with the same stupid blather as previously.\\nEventually I hung up, and wrote a complaint, to which Natwest staff said I had refused to speak to them, which is a complete lie. They refused to provide me with anything when i repeatedly asked for it!\\nSo I got a certified copy of my passport and ID, sent it to them and they then closed my account for reasons they were 'not obliged to disclose'.\\nFor why wife, for whom I had been putting money into her account to pay for cancer treatment where we lived, they just closed her account with 'so sorry' that might convince a lawyer but no one else. I asked them to reconsider due to my wife's circumstances, but they completely ignored all correspondence.

I wrote to Natwest, and said she has died, could I have the balance of funds, so they helpfully acknowledged and said her account was closed.\\nRang them up, said what I had written about but they had no records of any letter, even the reference I cited was unknown. The 'bereavement team' refused to do anything to help, wouldn't write to me, wouldn't give an email address, I had to write to them first. So I did, got a certified copy of the death certificate (I was the notifier on the death certificate and clearly stated as the husband), my ID, and proof of address.

There have been multiple issues which have this month come to a head.\\nIn the time since 2014 Natwest have refused us an overdraft on all three occasions we took the time to try and apply through their convoluted system. During this time we have never had a loan, never defaulted on any payments, averaged between £20k - £48k turnover on a monthly basis (it's seasonal work) and run all of our utilities payments and PDQ machine takings and BACS payments through the account as well as operating our VAT account through Natwest. They did well from us in monthly fees and other additional transfer costs as we purchased from the US on many occasions.\\nRegardless, they seemed more than disinterested in offering us any sort of assistance in growing the business, which is disappointing and frustrating seeing as they like to promote themselves as the best bank for small businesses. I do not agree with them on this.\\nI have not once been able to talk to their small business representative, of which they have one person in the south west of the UK, at one point I was handed his mobile number after my frustrations became clear, he never returned a call, in 3 years. No one in branch (I tried in Chiswick where I opened the account, Bristol where the business operated from and Bath repeatedly) will discuss anything to do with small business bank accounts, other than letting you deposit cash or cheques, or take out cash and forgetting to assign references to transactions when requested, which may seem like a small error but is in-fact very important when book keeping and talking to HMRC. As any small business owner can attest to, keeping your book keeping as clear and informative as possible is a large step on the way to staying profitable.\\nWe ended up staying with Natwest simply because I was too busy to do otherwise and it was synced with our Xero accounting and a 7-10 delay on reconciling the account would have been a difficult task to undertake during busy months.\\nAfter the lockdown affected our business ability to operate Natwest started asking us for all sorts of documents relating to our business structure, information that we did not have to provide previously but was now of utmost importance - list of directors, photo ID of directors, home address of directors, list of people with significant control, copies of DLA signed by our accountants, declaration of beneficial ownership.... We provided all of these and offered our own questions, such as why this was now necessary, why Natwest thought they had a right to our business details as they are just the bank that holds the money we have earned and what was their purpose for wanting these details. Every one of our questions went unanswered, the communication at Natwest to discuss these matters is worse than lacking it simply does not exist.\\nThis month and without any notice or warning Natwest closed both my business current and VAT accounts, basically making it impossible for us to trade when we are legally allowed to do so again.\\nThere is no one at the end of the phone at Natwest that can offer any assistance whatsoever with this matter. An email address does not exist, so there is conveniently no dated record of correspondence, I had to resort to (and I can't quite believe this) Facebook messenger to try and make contact, I received one reply which was deeply unhelpful and actually mostly consisted of more questions than answers, it has been two hours and I have not had an answer to my response.\\nI feel let down and left out to dry by the bank that I put my trust in, under their persuasion and apparent commitment to small business development. I can tell you now that this commitment they promote is a complete fabrication and the infrastructure does not exist within Natwest to help any small business grow or even stay afloat. Natwest have done more damage to us than I ever thought possible and they refuse to even discuss any of this with me.\\nAbsolutely shocking how bad, destructive and disinterested in customer care this bank is.\\n”\",\n",

       " [\"“\\nTook out a secured business loan with NatWest to buy the freehold of my property three years ago. They did all the usual checks upon checks including my Passport, Driving licence and Utility bills.\\nImagine my surprise to receive a letter from their 'Business Profile Team' on a letterhead with just their logo on and no 'NatWest'\\nname. Told me that they were doing a 'Business Profile' check on me to make sure everything was in accordance with the 'Financial Acts' etc and to 'Prevent Money Laundering, Crime, Evasion of Tax etc.' They asked me to send confidential documents to them via a link called 'Hooyu'. Now that sounds very 'Chinese' to me. We have been continuously told of 'fraudulent scams' and 'fraudulent activity'. So being worried, I called up my local 'Regional NatWest Business Centre' asking to speak to my 'Business Relationship Manager'. They said they had to take some 'security details' from me first. They asked me to provide my name, dob, name of business, how long I have been trading, the turnover, how many staff I employed, any other businesses I had, any overseas property I had, any other person who had 'authority' in the business etc. After I had given all the information, the guy told me they no longer have 'Business Relationship Managers' and all queries would be directed to a central line. When I told them about this 'Business Profile letter' and asked if it was 'real', the guy was very cagey and asked me to contact the number on the letter. I asked what it was about and he said to 'speak to the Business Profile team'.\\nWhen I called the number on the letter, the guy asked me the same questions, again, and unbelievably he said he couldn't find me on their 'system' !\\nHaving taken out a big 'Business Loan' secured on my property, only three years earlier, and having provided my Passport, Driving Licence, Business Utility Bills to them in person to them to get the loan, this guy at the end of the phone said he couldn't find me !!!\\nThe guy wanted to know how many times I had been out of the country, whether I had any businesses in any country, whether I had any properties in any country and how much I earned in the past twelve months.\\nI told him NatWest had all these personal and confidential details already but he still said he wanted me to to upload them onto 'Hooyu' and wanted me to send details of my accounts and a letter from my accountant. Otherwise, he would freeze my account and I wouldn't be able to pay in or withdraw my money and they would close my account if i didn't 'co-operate' !\\nThe guy was extremely rude, unpleasant and threatening. How do you expect customers to remain with NatWest?\\nHow can they say they can't find you on their 'system' when you have a large loan with them and with a direct debit paying them back monthly ?\\nI spent the following two days opening a new account with another bank. The new bank told me not to worry and they would sort everything out for me. They did that without any hassle. They transferred all the direct debits and standing orders over to the new account within three days.\\nEverything is great with the new bank and the 'service' is miles better than NatWest. Don't hesitate, guys ! change banks immediately, if NatWest continues to employ idiots to give you a hard time and make you out to be 'criminals', when you have done nothing wrong !\\nNatWest ? avoid them ! worst banking experience I have ever had and I have been in business for over forty years\\n”\",\n",

They don't care about you and the service is unbelievably painful and wrong. And it's taking 3 months to get processed.\\nI applied for a business bank account for my start-up company in December 2019, now is almost end of March and they came up with numerous reasons and demand for supporting documents that you won't understand. I gave a good indication of my business intends to do and had a very long and detailed conversation with one of their case handlers at the very beginning of the process. That same person is coming up with all sorts of requests every now and then. It's like pushing the last bit of toothpaste in the tube. Sooooooo s....l.......o.......w............ !\\nBecause we work with overseas business to promote the best of British products and services, they scrutinise heavily on verifying our potential suppliers. This is a new business, it's not like we have been trading for a decade. And if your supplier isn't from an English speaking country or region, they told you they couldn't verify that company. It's like they expect all other country to issue business certificates in English even if it's not their official language.\\nTwo months after my initial application, I finally went through the verification process. This case handler guy actually sent me an email saying no worries you will have the bank account opened in a few days. The bank is just going through some final steps. And we won't need anything else from you! bla-bla-bla. So I was rest assured that my account will finally be ready shortly. A real liar and total time-wasting idiot!\\nGuess what, a few days later. He sent me another email saying because you intend to do this, we need to see this document. I got really confused and if this is needed, why not inform me to go and prepare for this document. This is after 2 months, and you tell me I need to get another document. Didn't you say I don't need no more documents?? Din't I tell you what the business is all about? Why it never came to your peanut-sized brain that this document is required?\\nThis bank deserves to go out of business. If customers don't mean anything to you, you don't deserve my any business!\\nI have been a Natwest customer for over 15 years.

Natwest first demanded from me proof of ID and proof of address, then gave me the run around when I asked why, at first repeating the blather of 'important to have an up to date profile of you', and when I challenged why, they cited legal and regulatory reasons, which they then said they had 'no obligation to disclose'. Made it clear though it was my 'choice' whether I gave them anything, but if I didn't they might consider closing my account.\\nTo send anything though, well they failed to provide any address to send anything to when I specifically requested it, said it would come in an email which it didn't, instead I got a useless email asking me to contact them again, and then when I did we went into the death spiral of them again with the same stupid blather as previously.\\nEventually I hung up, and wrote a complaint, to which Natwest staff said I had refused to speak to them, which is a complete lie. They refused to provide me with anything when i repeatedly asked for it!\\nSo I got a certified copy of my passport and ID, sent it to them and they then closed my account for reasons they were 'not obliged to disclose'.\\nFor why wife, for whom I had been putting money into her account to pay for cancer treatment where we lived, they just closed her account with 'so sorry' that might convince a lawyer but no one else. I asked them to reconsider due to my wife's circumstances, but they completely ignored all correspondence. She had only been a customer for I think 25 years so obviously not an important one.\\nAs she could barely speak, could barely walk, she couldn't do anything they wanted to transfer the balance of funds, so they helpfully sent a Sterling cheque when now she had no bank account anywhere.\\nFast forward, she passed away, from Stage 4 cancer. I wrote to Natwest, and said she has died, could I have the balance of funds, so they helpfully acknowledged and said her account was closed.\\nRang them up, said what I had written about but they had no records of any letter, even the reference I cited was unknown. The 'bereavement team' refused to do anything to help, wouldn't write to me, wouldn't give an email address, I had to write to them first. So I did, got a certified copy of the death certificate (I was the notifier on the death certificate and clearly stated as the husband), my ID, and proof of address. Again, a letter weeks later confirming my wife's account had closed, ignoring everything else.\\nAt this point, rang again, and spent 30 minutes in a call, mostly on hold, to go through every point all over again!\\nStill waiting for that cheque....\\nI have complained about all this latest drama, but they haven't acknowledged the complaint, so when I go to complain again I can't even give them a reference because it seems they have ignored it.\\nYou also can't complain to the banking ombudsman about the way they behave unless you get them to acknowledge the complaints process is exhausted, so if the ignore you completely they have it sewn up.\\nIf Natwest were any other business, they would be in serious trouble.\\nI will certainly never go near them again.\\n”\",\n",

I keep filling in forms telling them that I left Republic of Ireland in 2001 after only having been there a year, and have been back in the UK since then. Eventually, with no satisfaction, I went into a branch. The assistant made a phone call and said that it was due to the bank still having a phone number on my records relating to Ireland. We duly changed this - I had my passport id with me, so that it was possible. We then completed the forms FOR THE UMPTEENTH TIME, and ALL of the forms were taken by the bank to be posted using the bank post. I expected to hear NOTHING more on this issue. But today, 20th December, I have had YET FURTHER HARRASSMENT, telling me that if I don't reply and complete the forms within 10 days, my details will be passed on to the tax body. NATWEST HAS NO RIGHT TO PASS ON MY DETAILS, AND THIS COULD CAUSE ME NO END OF GRIEF FROM AN OVERSEAS TAX OFFICE. How DARE YOU NATWEST? I have tried phoning the 'Helpline' on the letter - after 20 minutes STILL NO ANSWER, and I am being charged because it is not a free phone number! What a truly disgusting bank!

Had fraud on my account with name similar to a bank staff who served me (could purely be a coincidence and no insinuation to NATWEST). I was unable to pursue or ask questions because member of staff in question had left the bank together with the mortgage broker who served me but failed to process my paperwork.

The member of staff admitted there was no reason for the cheque to be returned to me. Tried to complain to customer services but line was disconnected.\\nRenewed my mortgage rate in September online (not trusting to deal with staff), sent off documents with cheque for the fixed rate charge. I received a letter weeks later informing me that due to the high volume of work they were unable to process my cheque and asked that I pay by phone!\\nSubject Access Request I made in May was eventually released in August. 2 months out of the 30 day timescale under GDPR.\\nStill have account but moved by daily activities and savings to another trusted bank.

      "my 7 months pregnant daughter had to pay for her divorce of £30,000. she had money in different accounts and arranged to pay all the money into natwest and do the transaction to her solicitor. we went to the bank with £10,000 cash, from a bond that she cashed in. she tried to pay cash in through machine, but it didn't work, meanwhile a member of staff called over from the other side of a screen, quite loudly, to pay small bundles in at a time. we gave up and went to the cashiers desk, my daughter was asked where she got the cash from, she told cashier it was a bond and the cashier asked why it wasn't paid direct into natwest account.... once money was paid into natwest my daughter asked for all her money in the account to be transferred to solicitor, the cashier told her to go queue on the other side. she stood in queue for 8minutes (7months pregnant and upset to have to pay ex £30,000) cashier no.2 arrived and asked my daughter again , where she got the cash from that was just paid in? my daughter answered and also told her she had just told cashier no.1. cashier then asked who are you paying? why are your paying? and other questions, at which point my pregnant daughter burst into tears and explained she was getting a divorce etc. she was then subjected to more questions... then had to stand whilst we waited for cashier no.3 to authorise the payment..... behind us had built up quite a queue all listening to my daughters divorce issues and listening to her cry her eyes out.\n",

Went back to cex to be fobbed off. Only by another person who spoke to me like I was a two year old. Again never looked at phone only have me same speech the last lad did. It’s like there trained to do tell the same thing to all. Was absolutely disgusted. These are young people trained to lie. They have not heard the last from me.

Untill I got home the charger was the wrong size and didn't fit I thought easy mistake I'll go back tomorrow and get it swapped by the way £165 I spent !! So I went back explained what had happened thinking they would swap the charger that would be the end no . Why have u got the charger u don't get that u don't buy a device from here and be supplied with a charger not even a wire that's not our policy that's not Nintendo's policy . Nintendo apparently don't supply any means of making the device u have bought work !!! I do not believe this I have previously owned 3 other 3ds s and always had a wire supplied !! They made me feel ridiculous next thing was well u can have a refund but u will have to leave it with us for 1 hr 30 so we can run a diagnostic s check as it's left the store I bought this yesterday st 430 it's now 930 the next day and I haven't got a lead to charge it .. then it will take 3-5 days for the refund our staff member should not have given u a charger !! I asked her about the box leads and warranty she said all included TRAIN YOUR STAFF !!! I feel utterly ridiculous ,spoken to like I'm an idiot and totally disgusted by your staff manner ,customer service and the way they laughed when i left the shop !!! Never ever shop here they take your money laugh at u and make up stupid rules .

Having only bought it the previous day took it back to the shop with receipt for my money back only to discover that it MUST be put through a “warranty test” to justify my return. After 20 mins or so the staff member assured me the device was okay as he had been “playing it” non stop since i dropped it in ( that’s some extensive warranty test!”) Anyway, with these red flags now raised in my mind i thought it was best that i declined the device and requested my money back. I was utterly outraged when they told me we can’t return you’re money as it’s only an instore voucher we can provide, i thought the bloody cheek, first sell me an item that doesn’t work properly then refuse to hand me back the cash i paid for it eventhough i returned the item within the two day window (confirmed time limit from a member of staff in the IRVINE CEX). I wouldn’t recommend this mob as they falsely advertise their warranty and aren’t willing to budge even with the phrase “the customers always right”.

       "\"“\\nAbsolutely disgusting with the treatment I received in the cex shop in Cavan Ireland. Bought a phone here with disabled shortly after purchase. Brought it back to be rudely told they couldn’t do anything that I’d have to bring it to repair shop.did so and man in repair shop told me it was faulty and bring it back to cex and don’t let them fob you off. Went back to cex to be fobbed off. Only by another person who spoke to me like I was a two year old. Again never looked at phone only have me same speech the last lad did. It’s like there trained to do tell the same thing to all. Was absolutely disgusted. These are young people trained to lie. They have not heard the last from me. This shop needs highlighting and should not be allowed rip people off like they do. I say shut them down.\\n”“\\nOnly I can’t give it a zero review I bloody well would!!!! I bought a phone in my local CEX store on the 2/12/21 the phone hadnt been working from I got it the speaker was not working right probably down to the fact the day I got it the lad serving me dropped it on the counter so I took back today they told me to leave with them for 40 mins to check it over then I go back in only to be told £72 voucher exchange or £57 cash absolute bloody joke I paid £155 for the phone so I’m out £98 and I cannot afford to buy a new phone now until way after Xmas stay clear of this shop if you don’t want robbed or fobbed off!!!!!!!!\\n”“\\nI have given them a 1 star but they deserve a minus 10 never in my life have i ever recieved such service such utter twaddle in my life ! 43 years on this earth and I thought I had heard it all . I purchased a 3ds from the store in cramlington it was easy she got it out I selected a few games she put it in a box and went and got the charger put it in and i paid HAPPY !! Untill I got home the charger was the wrong size and didn't fit I thought easy mistake I'll go back tomorrow and get it swapped by the way £165 I spent !! So I went back explained what had happened thinking they would swap the charger that would be the end no . Why have u got the charger u don't get that u don't buy a device from here and be supplied with a charger not even a wire that's not our policy that's not Nintendo's policy . Nintendo apparently don't supply any means of making the device u have bought work !!! I do not believe this I have previously owned 3 other 3ds s and always had a wire supplied !! They made me feel ridiculous next thing was well u can have a refund but u will have to leave it with us for 1 hr 30 so we can run a diagnostic s check as it's left the store I bought this yesterday st 430 it's now 930 the next day and I haven't got a lead to charge it .. then it will take 3-5 days for the refund our staff member should not have given u a charger !! I asked her about the box leads and warranty she said all included TRAIN YOUR STAFF !!! I feel utterly ridiculous ,spoken to like I'm an idiot and totally disgusted by your staff manner ,customer service and the way they laughed when i left the shop !!! Never ever shop here they take your money laugh at u and make up stupid rules . This ds was bought as a replacement for a disabled mans Christmas present i hope you are ashamed and laughing at that to.\\n”“\\nI have bought a second hand I phone with giving my old phone and added the difference, the stuff was a bit overwhelmed so It took me ages to verify everything and log out to my account ... but the phone still work and it is in a good condition for a good price\\n”“\\nZoie and Kieran at cex in Milton Keynes made such an effect for me and served me with a smile and patience, I was selling my Xbox series x and they went above and beyond to attend to my needs, bank transfer wasn't good for me and there wasn't much money left in their tills, they still went and checked all the tills to collect the money I needed.\\nwill defiantly recommend this store, great customer service.\\n”“\\nI sold in two iPhones because I’m struggling for money, they claimed that the phones where damaged, I had photos of the phones before shipping them to CeX. CeX sent the phones back to me damaged, I made a complaint and they filed a claim with Royal Mail and told me I had to wait 30 days (CeX paid postage so they were legally responsible for what happened to my goods) so I waited and then I get this short email back basically saying they had an outcome with Royal Mail (which means they got paid compensation for my iPhone which they already shipped back to me) instead of giving me the compensation they told me that they will buy the damage phone, so they pocket the compensation of £85 and give me £34.99 so they are pocketing the compensation, trying to give me less and will get the phone fixed and sell it. They are very dishonest and try to scam disabled people like me\\n”“\\nA 3 star purely on the amount if dirt and yellow stains in every game I have bought, covered in stickers as well, why can't you clean your games ?\\n”“\\nReally bad place to shop, the phone I bought became faulty after 8 days and they claimed the fault was caused by me. They have been extremely rude and did not check the phone at all. They offer you guarantee but they will find every excuse not to honor this guarantee. And don't try even to take it with customer service as there is almost non. You can't phone or email them, only fill some online form which does not help as the person who replies is taking immediately the side of the shop without providing any kind of proof to the claims made by the Cex shop manager.\\nStay away they don't deserve even the one star, If I could give zero stars I would but unfortunately one star is the lowest grade\\n”“\\nTook laptop in last Wednesday did not receive cash. Went back in to the shop as could not contact by phone, they had not uploaded my bank details said they had done it now it is Monday afternoon still not received payment left 2 emails asking them to call me no one has called me still appalling service\\n”“\\nSold my mobile at cex. very fair with the price offered. More than i expected. Very friendly staff. Will be using for buying and selling in future. would highly recommend.\\n”“\\nBought a oculus rift s a year ago, took it back under warranty after a technical fault with the head set to be told its void because there is a crack in the hand control.\\nThe staff in particular sam (the store manager apparently) in Guildford branch actually laughed in our face and then slammed the laptop shut and said I refuse you service! Disgusting, left a heart broken 10yr old boy. NEVER will I enter a Cex store ever again.\\n”“\\nProduct I bought (£525 graphics card) arrived damaged and broken.\\nContacted immediately upon delivery and showed images. They come back with “sorry it didn’t leave us like it. We cannot help any more”.\\nUnbelievably poor. Steer clear.\\n”“\\nJust never recieved my order. Contacted them about it, it was delivered to a post office miles from me and I was told to collect it and its tough. You have to pay for delivery too, so just dont use them.\\n”“\\nThey have very very bad customer service. They sell faulty goods and state that their warranty does not cover 'customer damage' when in fact the goods they sell are already faulty.\\nbought some ear pods 27 September 2021 for £60. took them back 3 weeks later and told them left ear bud not working. They did their 'diagnostic' which lasted 10 minutes. They then told me it is working fine. Continued to have problems and took them back (twice within 2 months of purchase).\\nThey then tell me pin is damaged and that their warranty does not cover customer damage. I told them that I hardly used the buds. They were not interested!!!!!\\nnever buy anything from these crooks. Spoke to someone who worked for them. He said they buy items off of people and just put them on display without checking properly.\\n”“\\nOnly they want is your money nothing else\\n”“\\nSo called warranty was voided because screw was missing when they checked it But it was there when it was securely posted Won’t be using this company again\\n”“\\nGreedy!!\\nThey had a dvd of me for 90p and sell for £6\\n”“\\nDvd s price they give u about 1 penny\\n”“\\nNo after service will not be going to cex shop again samsung a70\\n”“\\nI sold goods to get instore credit in a voucher, the voucher dosent work online? Customer service is useless, I've been contacting them for over a week to get this resolved. This should be a 2 minute phone call, not this ridiculousness\\n”“\\nWorkers are useless haven't got a clue and con you got a silly girl who took the Wii console and said she couldn't take the controller gave a receipt to get the money but when I went back was told they couldn't take it as there's no controllers maybe get workers who know what they are doing and talking about. Absolutely shocking workforce\\n”“\\ndid not deliver item and still waiting 2 weeks later and they send this\\nOn 2 Nov 2021, at 10:28, CeX wrote:\\nHi Simon,\\n\\nThank you for your patience.\\n\\nI have checked with the store and it seems that due to some mixup the AMD Radeon RX 580 was sent to an incorrect address and the other customer's order was sent to your address. I apologise for the inconvenience caused to you.\\nFeedback has been given to the store that fulfilled the order so that going forward no such instances happen.\\n\\nCan you please confirm if you have received an iPad Pro case via post?\\n”“\\nHI. I`ve been conned by a guy in CEX Westmoreland street Dublin when buying a computer. A\\n”“\\nWould never buy from cex again. Bought a Samsung tablet in May 2021 with a 24month warrenty, 5months after buying it the screen has got lines on it, taken it back to the Portsmouth branch where we bought it, to be told it has been dropped, we have not dropped it and looking on you tube it is a common problem that a wire has come loose, but have been told we have to pay £60 to get it repaired.\\nNot only have we been called liars but we have to pay to get it repaired. Totally disguised with the customer service, and the warrenty isn't worth the paper it is printed on.\\n”“\\nSo I brought a mac book air from cex it had taken me just under 8 months to save up for a second hand laptop. I have had the laptop for less then 4 months and now it has a charging fault. I took it back and now they are saying it damaged. I am so disappointed.i have used my laptop about 4 times over the sapce of 4 months and its always kept save and locked away where no one has acess. I had brought the laptop with some damages on it I am so stupid I should of taken pictures on arrival. I am trying me best to get this resolved I just can't afford to loose £300 it's left me so heartbroken and I just can't believe it. What's the worst thing I always go to this cex for my kids games and just browse and I always say hello to all staff.\\n”“\\nDO NOT buy pokemon gameboy games from this company. Two i've had have been fake & three have had no batteries in them. The store where i bought them wouldn't even replace a dead/dry battery but are happy enough to sell you it when you can't save your game. What do they actually test?? AVOID AT ALL COSTS!!\\n”“\\nTook my Fitbit versa in to sell to them- really great condition and they offered me £27.....fair enough so left it there to be tested came back after an hour to be told it was reported lost/ stolen.....U have a receipt from Amazon for it - bought it new in December 2019 so what the hell? I resent being labelled a thief especially in CEX which clearly does buy stuff from dodgy people! I have complained to Head Office and am now selling it elsewhere on line. Waste of time dealing with them.\\n”“\\nPray on the desperate and sell xbox series x for 200 quid more than an original.\\nProfiteering and should be illegal what they do.\\nTerrible company, with equally terrible moral trading standards.\\nDon't touch with a barge pole. Also known to fence stolen goods, which shoplifters steal and takenand sell to them.\\nAvoid like the plague. Zero stars.\\n”“\\nThey knowingly sent out a charger that did not fit the watch. Refused any partial refund for the wrong charger.\\nKept the watch because I have a charger.\\nUnimpressed.\\n”“\\nThere incompetent 5 times I've ordered dvds online and came back saying they weren't in stock but 10 days later my money wasn't refunded its a scam\\n”“\\nAbsolutely outrageous. My 7 year old daughter change her mind about 2 xbox360 games (£14) we have purchased. She has not even played them.\\nCame to store 4 days later to get a full refund obviously. Guess what? They have 2 days policy!!!!!! 2days!!!! I felt like I am trying to return out of date smelly fish!\\nI've been offered £5 for both games, because they CAN BUY IT from me!\\nI've never felt so ripped-off in my life.\\n”“\\nPurchased a Nintendo DS for my partner from CEX in KILMARNOCK, after playing she complained that there was a part missing and it wasn’t charging properly. Having only bought it the previous day took it back to the shop with receipt for my money back only to discover that it MUST be put through a “warranty test” to justify my return. After 20 mins or so the staff member assured me the device was okay as he had been “playing it” non stop since i dropped it in ( that’s some extensive warranty test!”) Anyway, with these red flags now raised in my mind i thought it was best that i declined the device and requested my money back. I was utterly outraged when they told me we can’t return you’re money as it’s only an instore voucher we can provide, i thought the bloody cheek, first sell me an item that doesn’t work properly then refuse to hand me back the cash i paid for it eventhough i returned the item within the two day window (confirmed time limit from a member of staff in the IRVINE CEX). I wouldn’t recommend this mob as they falsely advertise their warranty and aren’t willing to budge even with the phrase “the customers always right”. AVOID like the plague of zombies that pollute Kilmarnock burns mall. These jokers are rip off merchants.\\n”“\\nBought a used laptop from Crystal Peaks Sheffield. The 2 year warranty was attractive and I mistakenly trusted they would be decent and honest to deal with. It failed after a few months but CEX would not honour the guarantee. I accept the laptop was bought as 2nd class because of previous owner mishandling but if CEX want to play that game ,don't pretend it has a warranty. Very disappointed with CEX and would advise against using them.\\n”“\\nBrought a iPhone SE within a week the screen developed a fault and then went off completely. Took back into store and said about it asked for instore voucher so I could get a replacement and they came back saying I have damaged the scree it’s not covered on the 24 month warranty as it’s classed as accidental damage.. so wasted £360 and a useless phone and CEX staff it’s my fault and should be more careful.\\nCEX warranty is a complete joke and staff are rude.\\n”“\\nPlease do not buy from cex. I went to get a Xbox one controller to find out it's cheaper to buy them brand new. When to return the item to be told i camt have my no at back only in store credit. RIP OFF\\n”“\\nCex pay next to nothing for games etc, sold a few to them then had 2 returned to me with no explanation, no email, nothing. Our exchange came to £2.83 instead of the £6.86. Avoid and sell privately....\\n”“\\nAvoid avoid avoid.\\nI bought a game off their Tallaght shop (dublin ireland). The game just wasnt the right edition iwas looking for. Only figured when i got home. Went back to the shop a day later bt would nt give me a refund coz theysaid therewasbt anythi g wrong with game even after i explai ed it wasnt what i was looking for. They gave me an in store voucher i stead bt that meant i cant use that money to buy game in another shop. My money is nw locked in their shop so nw i have no choice but come back to cex. Any other shop would have given a refund to card used when making the purchase. I do nt recommend buying from Cex.\\n”“\\nDo not buy from cex..pay a few pound more for new\\nX box controller under warranty...4 times same fault..they refused to repair again..even though previous repairs free of charge..incompetent engineers..cheap parts badly fitted\\n”\""
