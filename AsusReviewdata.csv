This issue was not related tot he mother board's malfunction and would not have happened if the mother board had not malfunctioned BUT ASUS used it as an excuse to not honor the warranty of their product.

I have contacted customer service multiple times with little information.

When a charge was sent me for my repair, I had issues paying it and called to confirm if the payment was received. The customer service representative said ""oh yeah it's all good."" Cut to two weeks later, I get a call saying my repair has been delayed because of issue with payment.

Weeks later I call customer service again for a general update. The representative informs me my laptop has shipped and was delivered! I was happy but confused, I had never received a tracking number. It wasn't delivered. I asked the representative for the tracking number, and doublechecked for myself with them on the line. They had given me the tracking number for when I shipped the device TO Asus, all the way back in April. This representative practically made me do their job by checking the tracking number. Then they said they would escalate my case and I would be contacted in 48 business hours. Weeks pass I call again.
Still waiting for my laptop, that just needed the RAM replaced.

Also your phone survey never works. I have called 6+ times in the past 2 and half months. It's as if you don't want to hear how disorganized your operation is.

53,8/27/18 1:11PM,"I bought an ASUS notebook on 22.05.2017 in Lisboa, Portugal. With a few months of active and consistent use, the notebook began to function improperly for a few months, shutting itself down and restarting the system randomly (sometimes with a spacing of several weeks due to the little use it was given in the meantime) and interrupting abruptly important work calls via Skype, among other operations. I waited until the 4th \ 5th occurrence until I was sure that it was indeed a malfunction of the laptop and not any restart due to an update of the operating system. After this last occurrence (on January 2018), during which the sound of the notebook became a loud noise and after which the notebook turned off, I decided to go directly to ASUS (in my home country Portugal) to solve the situation.
The laptop came back with an unsatisfactory diagnostic report. No anomaly had been detected. As soon as I got home and tested the laptop, I noticed that the sound of it had worsened. Poor sound quality, although random, was more frequent. Extremely dissatisfied, I then decided to go to the shop where I had bought my computer directly (FNAC), explaining my previous situation with the technical support services of ASUS, to which I had submitted a formal complaint by e-mail at the time. The laptop was sent again for repair and returned without the charger (the shop was kind enough to lend me a charger until it was resent) and with the same sound problems as well as a new problem, having in the meantime turned on from suspension mode without any intervention from me (or anyone else). I returned to the shop. The notebook was resent for repair services (to ASUS).
After the 3rd shipment to repair the laptop, I tried to send a registered complaint letter addressed to ASUS. The letter was returned after giving me the wrong address by telephone. I have all the evidence regarding this episode, as well as all emails that prove the incorrect and confusing information regarding the address provided by ASUS. In the meantime, I decided to send a complaint letter through ASUS website (in Portugal) and I added an aggravating note due to the inaccuracy of the shared postal address.
After the 3rd shipment to repair the laptop, it returned with even greater problems in terms of operation. I returned the equipment again for repair and decided to resort to a Portuguese customer rights association support to resolve this situation. Subsequently, I received an email from the shop explaining that the 4th return was had the same diagnosis (nothing was wrong according to ASUS technical assistance services) and also with the aggravating factor: a diagnosis budget of 30 Euros. (no repair had been done and ASUS Portugal was asking me to pay a diagnosis budget.
I resent a formal complaint by letter to ASUS Portugal with a video showing the malfunction of the labtop. Someone called me and said they would take care of it (and help me) and that they would call me the following week. I have not received any call back since then (June 2018).
The shop where I bought my notebook identified the same technical problem as I did and sent a video to ASUS repair assistance. I haven't had access to my laptop since January. It's almost September. ASUS Portugal hasn't fixed the problem yet (totally within the warranty - I had to return the notebook 7 months after I bought it) and they haven't contacted me yet with a solution. I also made a complaint at the shop where I bought the computer.
This story seems almost unbelievable to me. I was advised by friends and at FNAC to buy the ASUS laptop in question but I am extremely dissatisfied with my purchase. I've owned computers for over 20 years and have never come across such a situation. I have never had a new computer that gave me problems in the first few months of use and I have never thought that it would be possible to have a problem and not be solved by its guarantee (in any situation or purchase made by me up to date). I bought an ASUS laptop because of its ethical production compared to other brands. It was my first experience with your brand and I am extremely sorry about it.
I therefore appeal to your integrity and support as a brand in order to resolve this situation as quickly as possible, in the best possible way. I am extremely dissatisfied with this situation, which has not only also made me lose a lot of time in vain as well as it has left me without my main working instrument, which is my right as your client (I have not been using the laptop for many months due to the numerous repair attempts and the notebook is formatted whenever this happens.

58,1/26/18 12:24PM,"Please never buy anything from Asus. Seriously, the products themselves are usually great, but the consumer service can be a big problem. In my case, what happened is that I was about to send back my unit at the end of november 2017. Then I called back during my break, at the beginning of january. At first, I was told that everything was ok, I just had to send back the notebook. As it was the second time I was sending back the item to have it repaired, I expected to receive the instructions checklist and shipping label (Fedex). However, nothing was sent. I contacted back Asus, to ask for the documents.

I was told that the invoice is missing. That is where the problem really is. I had to send back the invoice twice, as it was rejected for being ""not acceptable"" without any further explanation. After that, I was sent back an e-mail saying that the warranty ended on January 9th of 2018. As I live in Quebec, the date format is different. The date was reading as ""01-09-16"" (Standing for 1st day of ninth month 2016). After a few calls to Asus, I had them to contact the seller. I confirmed with the seller that he said clearly that the date was canadian french format, standing for 1st of september, but Asus maintained its position and said that the seller even confirmed that date (january ninth).


Another call was needed by the seller, and I was told all would be great by the seller, after 7 or 8 call to Asus and 2 calls to te seller. However, to my surprise, I was told that the shipping was on my charge, to the opposite of what happened in november. WHY are Asus changing their mind and only contributing to make their image worse...

They say that they could not change the socket only, had to replace the screen and charge 415 TL (109 $), can only replace the socket after charging the amount.

I do not hold them accountable to this as i am an IT professional. My gripe is that after holding for quite some time, the first representative told me i would be contacted by a product expert within 24-48 hours via email. When I was not contacted in this time frame i called back on a Saturday and after being on hold again for a while, i was told that weekends do not count for the turn around time and that i would be contacted by Monday or Tuesday at the latest. My initial call had been on a Thursday evening. I accepted this answer and asked for an email with a case number which i never received (i checked my spam filter). I called again the following Wednesday after hearing nothing and was told i would be transferred to an expert. After being on hold for over an hour, i spoke with Jhavonne who handled my problem and issued an RMA. I do not have a problem with the support itself as I am in IT Customer support and so understand the difficulties of the industry. My complaint is with the lack of follow through of what i was told would be done which was not and the amount of time and frustration i had to go through to have my problem actually addressed. It is ridiculous that i had to spend a week to have a hardware problem addressed when this device is being used for my work. The fact that neither of the tier 1 technicians followed through on their word (i acknowledge this may have been out of their hands with the hurdles of a large corporation) burned me the most.

The motherboard died and so I called ASUS customer no service because I had registered all my products and they would have all the info I needed on file to make a decision about the next step. Customer no service informed me that my warranty was up and I needed to buy a new motherboard, no problem; I bought the up graded new motherboard. I removed the old motherboard and installed the new one, after some updates everything is running great. I was wondering what to do with the old board and my wife reminded me that we still had all the boxes from the build in a spare closet, so I got the box and going through the box found out that the warranty was five years instead of three as I was told by customer no service. Being an ASUS fan, I thought ""no problem"" there must have been a mistake and they will take care of me. Was I ever wrong about that, what followed is the stuff of Tim Burtons real nightmares. I had never before created an account with ASUS, so I did and low and behold all the info was at my finger tips, dates, times, purchase info and WARRANTY info proving my case for me, problem solved right? WRONG, 7 plus hours on the phone, lots of time on hold, ""sorry the customer support center doesn't have access to THAT info"" was a great tag line.

If the packaging wasn't damaged, this must have occured in your facilities. Probably by being tossed.




Rosario did the best he could in an otherwise poor customer service environment.



Here's a challenge: Call the number WITH YOUR PERSONAL PHONE IN YOUR POCKET. You'll find scatchy sound that breaks up all the time. On multiple occasions I've heard people in a boiler room laughing and talking to eachother, but not to me. When the call is terminated, nobody calls me back.



I'm very unhappy with Asus, but Rosario did the best he could!

She knew I was frustrated, she stayed on point and resolved my problem very quickly.I have been on the phone for hours with Microsoft, my ISP and with by back up service, Acronis. She was direct, listened to my ramblings about what I have done to fix the problem. She knew how to fix this with a hard reset and yet she listened to me complain. She cut me off politely and directed me to follow her instructions. If she comes to you and tells you she got a better offer at another company, I would beat it and give her a company car! She was amazing and if she ever moves to Texas, I will find a place for her at my company!!



Thank you, Niqua, very very very much.

66,8/16/17 9:31AM,"I have been a fan of ASUS for a long time, my current build was in fact done with ALL ASUS products. The motherboard died and so I called ASUS customer no service because I had registered all my products and they would have all the info I needed on file to make a decision about the next step. Customer no service informed me that my warranty was up and I needed to buy a new motherboard, no problem; I bought the up graded new motherboard. I removed the old motherboard and installed the new one, after some updates everything is running great. I was wondering what to do with the old board and my wife reminded me that we still had all the boxes from the build in a spare closet, so I got the box and going through the box found out that the warranty was five years instead of three as I was told by customer no service. Being an ASUS fan, I thought ""no problem"" there must have been a mistake and they will take care of me. Was I ever wrong about that, what followed is the stuff of Tim Burtons real nightmares. I had never before created an account with ASUS, so I did and low and behold all the info was at my finger tips, dates, times, purchase info and WARRANTY info proving my case for me, problem solved right? WRONG, 7 plus hours on the phone, lots of time on hold, ""sorry the customer support center doesn't have access to THAT info"" was a great tag line. Submit this paper work in this format to this verification page and we will get back to you in a few days. What? this info is on ASUS.com site. I sent all the paper work only for ASUS to deny their own website info, that is not a joke. Hours spent ""chatting"" with a tech who said, ""I understand your frustration."" Really? You are the cause of it. This issue is still unresolved as of today ... shadily coercing people to buy new products and having a system that frustrates people and jerks them around works, to the detriment of ASUS.

I was only allowed to speak to the lower level customer service people who fed me lip service and did not elevate my request to the appropriate person. The service I received from your repair department has been deplorable. No one answered any of my disputes on the estimate for repair. My laptop was incorrectly diagnosed and an estimate was forwarded to me based on that incorrect diagnosis. I disputed this several times. Receiving no responses, I had to call your repair department because clearly contacting a client over repairs of their unit is of least importance to the department. Since no contact information was provided in the estimate email, it was necessary for me to contact online chat to get that information. When I spoke with a customer service person I was told the estimate stated the incorrect diagnosis but the price of $410 was correct. I know this part is used in other Asus products that hold a 2 year warranty. I also know that the part can be obtained direct from the manufacturer for under $200. When I disputed the price I was told I would receive a corrected invoice that would also reflect the largest discount available. That discounted estimate reflected a less than 10% discount. I again submitted a dispute in writing. Again, no one answered this dispute. I then sent an email through my Asus product account and received an auto response I would be contacted within 48 hours. That also was a lie. No one contacted me. Now I've received notification, after live chat and repair service were closed for the day (which seems to be common practice with Asus) stating my unit was being returned unrepaired. This is unacceptable. The service, or more accurately, the lack of service is not what I would expect from such a large company. I purchased my notebook for $1500, which I realize now would have been better spent with another brand. I have requested with each dispute I submitted to be contacted by an upper level supervisor. My requests for assistance were ignored. It appears Asus is only interested in collecting inflated repair costs and not customer service or retention.

For the same problem I have given the handset in your service center(F1 INFO SOLUTIONS & SERVICES PRIVATE LIMITED, AHMEDABAD) 3 times but I don't get proper solution from your service center. Prob. is coming continues. Also I have mailed 3 times to your customer care but no any response.



At present, I have no any mobile handset to use & your handset is also not running so I am facing big trouble & helpless condition without phone. So, I have put 4 videos in YouTube also.



Therefore I want to inform, If I'll not get any positive solution from your side then I have to complaint in GRAHAK SURAKSHA KENDRA & also put videos in YouTube also.



Waiting for your reply.

85,11/28/16 3:59PM,"From the moment of walking into ASUS customer service center in Markham Ontario there was no feeling that the employees of ASUS were looking to best help me, but actually looking to find a way out of fixing my phone.

This is my second ASUS zenphone 2, I love the device and have recommended it to numerous consumers. Recently my display on the phone started acting up becoming unresponsive at times (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kRuxTefNcKw). After some research it became clear that this was a known manufacturing default with the phone.

After speaking through ASUS chat feature they were able to quickly create a RMA number. I was able to drop off the phone at a nearby service location while on vacation. Upon entering the facility the demeanor of the employee changed from inviting to duplicitous.

He opened the phone to find a screw was missing from the back of the phone. I notified him that the only time the back was ever opened was to insert/ remove the sim card and memory card. After insisting that I had not tempered with the phone or have had any other party look at the phone he regrettably said that he would take a note.

Shortly after I received a quote for repair of 135$ as they were unable to look at the device as the screw was missing.

At this time I have lost all respect for the ASUS brand as this level of service is unacceptable. I will continue to spread the horrors of my experience with ASUS, in hopes that other consumers are not affected.",neg

90,11/17/16 8:00AM,"I bought a high end graphics card from Asus a week ago and kept getting DOA cards. I spent many hours trying to troubleshoot these graphics cards that were already dead. I would file an RMA with the supplier, return it, then get another DOA card, taking weeks out of my schedule.

My complaint is with Asus, though, for allowing such awful manufacturing defects and for reshipping cards that are already broken. If you use Google, one customer representative for Asus states that there are no seals on the graphics cards - so you can't even tell if your product was actually a used repackaged product.


I don't mind if the lower-end graphics cards have a high DOA rate - but when you dump almost a thousand dollars into a card you should expect to see a quality product that works on the first try. In any other kind of industry you will never hear, ""Oh, keep returning until you get one that works.""

The worst part is that you'll see Asus customer service representatives advertising their services all over various forums to look good - the comments below included. However, if you give them an email you will need to wait a long time for a response and you will not likely get much from them. On several instances I never received any emails back from my issues.

If you spend thousands on products over the years as an enthusiast, but you're not one of their partners, you'll never get anything extra. Even if you get dozens of defective products from Asus and waste dozens of hours trying to put on of their defective parts into a computer, you'll never even get a $5 coupon from them for the inconvenience.

Here's one last kicker: Asus's rebates. If you buy Asus products, you'll see that you're eligible for rebates. Unfortunately, you need to go through their third-party site, AsusRebates - but I still hold Asus responsible since they're the ones who obviously contracted their services out to this party. The whole site is a scam. The majority of the time it's offline and even certain parts of the form won't load at certain times of the day. I live in an EST timezone, and I had to wake up at 3AM to complete the form online for my rebate.

Then, you have to give all the paperwork, including cutouts of barcodes from the cardboard and printed receipts. Unfortunately, depending on where you live, this will not cost the same as mail with just paper in it due to the extra weight, so I ended up spending $5 just to mail out a $10 rebate.

- I asked: 'why did ASUS have me pay for Expedite'?















Do check out the reviews on ASUS Corporate, Amazon and ifixit websites sites. These sites reveal that the motherboard and battery issues on Transformer Books are not new.



Are these known issues with ASUS Transformer T100's? If so, why are they not resolved? Why are consumers being fooled into purchasing these T100's only to have issues with the motherboards, or batteries not holding a charge?



Is this the type of products and services Amazon would like to be associated or connected with?



ASUS Support techs are trained 'robots', scripted to be focus on resolving faulty products and not focus on customer satisfaction. Good business sense is to make the customer happy or satisfied so that we will return, not run far away.



As communicated to ASUS techs, supervisors and managers: this is the first and last ASUS device I will ever purchase. Should conversations regarding tablets, i-Pads, desktops, etc. comes up with my friends, relatives and co-workers, I would have to give my honest and frustrating experience.



If this were you or your loved one, how would you proceed? What would or should you expect? What would make me happy or satisfied for time spent, work stoppage, travel adjustments? Not to see ASUS devices again. In addition, a refund of my hard earned dollars, even if it is not a full refund.



Thank you for taking the time to read. In addition, taking the time to address and respond.",neg

The package from Asus arrived today. The rep was full of misinformation. Obviously, installing third party firmware on the router didn't void my warranty, because they sent a refurbished Asus RT-N66R (same as the RT-N66U).

They made me send my eebook (a e402MA if curious) for repair 3 times (due to hardware being defective) and when I asked for a replacement because the product was clearly not going to be fixed, they started stalling, saying they will replace it ONLY with a recertified not a new (even tho the warranty clearly says that they have to replace with a certified OR new) after 3 months+ of struggle - a nightmare that has not only impacted my productivity and made me have to retreat from an important research project but it also impacted my mental health and well being to the point of anxiety and stress ...ect - they sent me an email saying they will replace it with a refurbished device that was BELOW what I currently have, lower in ram/hdd and processor speed and replacing a laptop with a tablet..
mind you the email they sent me had a table to compare my ""laptop"" and the replacement, however the table had only a bunch of numbers thrown here and there and in no way were they mentioning what characteristics they were comparing. when I first looked at the table i was like wow that looks pretty nice actually going fro a 2G in ""something"" to a 500G was a nice offer! however being the decent literate human being (not the stupid blind person they think i am) I looked up online what they were offering me. and only did it have bad reviews, was of lower quality and price than mine BUT IT WAS ALSO CUTTING MY HDD BY HALF MY RAM A QUARTER among others, when I emailed them what i found they simply answered : blablabla tbh what we're offering you is better . (aka you're dumb and we know better)

THEN I NOTICED THE MODEL NUMBER THEY WERE COMPARING THEIR REPLACEMENT TO WAS NOT EVEN MY LAPTOP IT WAS SOME OTHER COMPELTLEY DIFFERENT MODEL. when I emailed them asking them nicely to re-verify their table because the model they are referring to is not the one i have, THEY STOPPED REPLYING TO MY EMAIL AND ANSWERING MY CALLS. and now when i call, my calls are dropped!!
ps: their warranty also states that the replacement should be of AT LEAST equal quality/function.
They have breached their own contract multiple times, shown insensitivity to their customer's concerns and misleading approach to pressure the poor helpless customer to accept their unfair and unjust ways.
oh and btw, they asked me to send the laptop again for ""inspection"" as if that didn't happen enough already, and me as the fool I am, sent it again. AND NOW I HAVE NO LAPTOP TO USE FOR MY SCHOOL AND INTERNSHIP/WORK, NO REPLIES FROM THE COMPANY ... needless to say I am suing the company, it will take time and wont be solved early enough to save me from more harm to my career and studies but I will go on with case and wont give up til the either see reason or the court gives me justice!!!

120,8/5/16 3:38AM,"I have an ASUS Zenbook with a touchscreen. The display ceased to function, so after many, many calls, I received an RMA and sent it back.
ASUS has now had the notebook for more than two weeks, and it does not have an ETA for receiving the necessary part or any plan if it cannot obtain the part. t will not commit to any date for taking action. So I have been without a computer for more than three weeks and there is no end in sight.
In addition, the customer service has been very, very bad. On one evening, my first six calls involved lengthy waits after which I was sent straight to the customer survey without speaking to an agent. When I finally got through, the service representative placed me on multiple holds while he tried to obtain information. That call ended while I was still on hold when again I was sent to the survey! The representative did not call back, as he promised he would if the call was dropped. A supervisor took my next call, but again he cannot provide any ETA for repair or an alternative resolution. So far, I have been on the phone for more than 7 hours trying unsuccessfully to obtain answers.

He listened, and he slowly, and patiently helped be update my internet adapters, and voila, I was online. And, he waited while I tried and waited until I gave him a thumbs up. So, my take on ASUS customer service is...if you get a jerk, hang up (politely if possible...it's not their fault, they aren't all good, that's all) and call again. Keep calling until someone understands your problem, then proceed. It's not a perfect compliment, but if you're lucky enough to get a Javhon or someone like him, you're day will be great.

I had to literally squeeze and risk scratching the laptop to try and get the zips to make it past the top edges of the laptop.The fit is so tight and ridiculous that there isn't anymore space for even the charger. I realized that the backpack meant for 15inch laptops, mine was a 15.6 inch one.MAYBE other 15.6 laptops can fit BUT MINE DOES NOT. After a few back and forth of emailing, with photos.

FIRSTLY, I'm not stupid. Anyone would know how to use a simple backpack.

SECONDLY, if you need to provide a guide on how to use a simple backpack, doesn't that say something about your product already? What do ASUS SG NOT UNDERSTAND? We all live in a fast paced world, we just want to use a product efficiently. For goodness sake it's a backpack, you're just supposed to put in laptop, zip and go and not HAVE TO STRUGGLE TO FIT IT IN AND RISK DAMAGING it. It is terrible that ASUS WOULD include accessories (backpack) that IS NOT suitable for the laptop? yes i know it's easy to just go out and buy another backpack but why should I? It was a bundle package and I DID HAVE TO PAY EXTRA FOR THE ACCESSORIES.

132,6/30/16 4:47AM,"ok who ever wrote a bad review about asus couldn't be more wrong. They aren't bad. they are WORSE than BAD!! Any way of putting NEGATIVE Stars?

I bought a small desktop unit and K20BF and within one day I had to call MS because there was an issue with the windows install to which MS, (surprisingly) gave a good service. We successfully fixed the issue. Next problem was the HDMI port does not send a signal to the monitor to go into sleep mode nor does it even detect the monitor (tried 2 monitors) to which I finally fixed the issue of detecting the monitor because it would only work with a generic driver. But if the computer goes off the HDMI port no longer ""talks"" to the monitor so instead of it telling it to ""sleep"" it displays a ""check your cable connection"" message, which is usually due to a video card fault of some sort. Be it as it may I accepted that too. But what I found completely and utterly absurd was when the keyboard went faulty after 1 week and 4 keys refused to work, I then hooked up another keyboard (standard TS procedure) and it worked fine. So I call Asus and the agent I spoke with, a complete jackass, first tells me he needs to put me on HOLD to find out the options available to me for a faulty keyboard. I guess a congressional meeting of the highest powers is required in order to decide something sooooooo complicated. He comes back after leaving me on hold for about 6 minutes and tells me ( and you will love this), ""You need to send in your computer."" WTF??? I had just finished telling him that the system works fine with another keyboard but this one had 4 keys that were faulty. So I demand to speak to a supervisor. Putting aside that AGAIN, he leaves me on hold but this time for almost 20 minutes, which in call centers is taboo. I been working in call centers for 13 years and no matter how long you need to keep a customer on hold, you check in with then at a reasonable interval varying somewhere between 2 and 5 minutes depending on call center policies. Nevertheless the sup apologizes for the hold time and replies with something stupid like, ""we are unusually busy right now"". WTF does busy have to do with an agent checking in with you? He then proceeds to try to convince me that the pc has to be sent in and that if the keyboard is faulty they would repair it. NO ONE REPAIS KEYBOARDS. It's NOT COST EFFECTIVE!! Again, putting all that aside, why would I want to send in a brand new computer in for a faulty keyboard? It JUST ISN'T DONE!!
Stay away from Asus. They may have reasonably good products in general, but the support they have (or lack there of), is not there and they don't have the customer's interest. Rule #1 is customer service: YOU DON'T PISS OFF THE CUSTOMER!! Service is EVERYTHING today and Asus doesn't seem to realize that. Or if they do, they aren't aware of what their call centers are doing to them.
Someone posted above that they don't understand why so many people are posting bad reviews? Well buddy, you're in a world of your own, cause everyone else has had bad experiences with a company I one thought was better than Acer.

The product I have bought is an ASUS GTX970 STRIX OC.

I removed the card, took it back to my supplier and put in my old card which, as expected, played the games flawlessly, albeit at a much lower resolution, yet, no black-screens and loss of display input.

When said display input happens, windows simply points toward the classic nvdklml or whatever their driver file is called, which is a problem as ambiguous as it can get.


So, having decided that the card is defective (after multiple driver installs, lowering clocks, changing entire card to make sure the PCI-express slot was functional) I told my supplier to send it back for an RMA. 1 week later, I'm curious as to what is taking ASUS so long to respong to a bloody mail for a simple RMA, my supplier is not sure either so I let it slide for one more week.

Today I just called my supplier and they told me that ASUS had decided to take the incredible liberty of trying ""repair"" it, instead of RMA'ing it. Needless to say this is beyond infuriating after having to deal with the defective product ruining my gaming sessions for over 2 months now, so I'm gonna have to wait god knows how long now for ASUS to ""REPAIR"" the product, IF they do and they will send me back the same thing that DIDN'T BLOODY WORK and I'm expected to take it and expect that someone it's repaired. OR worse yet, the people responsible for repairs simply run horribly out-dated synthetic stress tests that prove absolutely nothing of its functionality instead of testing it in real games and they simply send it back and repair nothing.

This is the first AND last money ASUS is ever seeing from me. On top of the very first product I buy being defective, I have to deal with their preposterous customer support on top of it and wait even longer. Shameful display.",neg

138,6/17/16 5:01AM,"After some time this motherboard started having issue with initial boot as it will only power on after disconnecting the power supply and waiting for few minutes. I tried almost everything: replaced CPU, RAM, PSU and nothing helped.

As I'm located in currently Israel I had to ship the motherboard to ASUS RMA center in USA. That costs about $60. After about 3 weeks I received the same motherboard with the same exact issue.


Now the motherboard's DRAM_LED would stay solid red and the motherboard won't POST at all. I've contacted ASUS and they asked me simply to reship the motherboard to them (and pay another $60 to cover shipping to and from the USA). When I told them that I've already sent it once and covered shipping costs both ways and they returned it unfixed the representative told me that nothing can be done and closed the chat. I sent the motherboard to them a second time and after about 2 weeks I got the motherboard and found that nothing was fixed! It still has the DRAM_LED issue. When I contacted them they simply asked me to reship it to them overseas again!

Think twice before buying anything ASUS! I have another 3 motherboard (from Gigabyte) and they've never had any issues.

I sent my tablet for out-of-warranty repair, and when I got it back, they had fixed my tablet's power charging issue but they failed to test the adaptor that connected to the cord, which did not work. (and I even noted that on the initial paperwork) Thus, my tablet still wasn't charging. So I called Customer Service and spoke to some guy named Andre, who basically defended that it had been tested correctly and that I should buy a new one from their online store. We went around and around on the phone for over 15 minutes. Haha, what a joke. I paid almost $100 for a three year old tablet, and they couldn't throw in a 50-cent piece of equipment made in China?! And they didn't even mention it in a communication, in the quote, or on the packing slip. Clearly by how he communicated with me, he implied I was lying or making it up. Yeah, let me waste over a half hour of my time arguing or ""lying"" about a 50-cent piece of equipment. Unreal. Face it -- Asus made a mistake and never tested the adaptor, which I clearly noted in the initial paperwork. He couldn't accept that, nor did he offer to rectify it. There never was an ""I'm sorry"" or any kind of empathy... Lastly, he asked me if I wanted to take their customer service survey, and I said of course...and then I wait for over 10 minutes, and it never came on. I have a feeling he sensed I was angry and somehow blocked my ability to take the survey. So I hung up and called back, spoke to another person, and asked him if I could take the survey. He said the survey was tied to the interaction you have with the current caller, and I said that wasn't my problem, that I still wanted to take the survey. He declined and said he would email me a link to a feedback page, and I could leave my comments there.

152,5/5/16 2:43PM,"So let me begin by saying I have dealt with every major and some minor device manufacturers over 25 years. I have used ASUS products for YEARS. My current system is built with ASUS products, including my monitor, ASUS Rog Swift PG278Q. This is an 800.00 monitor so not a cheap LCD. After a year, the screen went bad. Two-thirds of the screen is blurry where the text is close to unreadable. So began ASUS RMA....

This process has started on 4/25/2016 and still, to this day (5/5/2016), I have a bad monitor in my possession. Credit Card holds, promised return phone calls, promised returned emails, promise this and promise that. Now, I can forgive the missing a call here or there, we are human. I can forgive the forgetting of an email, we are human. I can not forgive multiple reps and supervisors both telling me that after they verbally confirmed my product was in stock for replacement, the system showing plenty in stock for replacement, having my RMA changed due to ""No stock for two weeks"". Today I was told the computers systems are being upgraded and eventhough the system shows plenty in stock, only the service department knows the real count. Little did this rep know that a service department employee visually and verbally checked the stock 24 hours before. Funny part is his counting matched that of the system. Advance RMAing a product does require stock. Given this high-end product is still an active product, one would think that you could get a replacement. Best I could pull off was Standard RMA with a promised FedEx label emailed to me....which I never received. I requested a NIB or a replacement of equal or better value which sounds fair but not for ASUS. I am disgusted that it takes this much effort to get a Warranty upheld and for a company to actually do real customer service. If anyone knows who to contact please post it...",neg

158,4/29/16 10:51AM,"The only review that matters with ASUS!! Let me start off by saying that i have been an avid ASUS supporter and buyer up until this point. Now, let me tell you the true side of this that I have encountered. I have had a board replaced 4 times in the past year. 1st board - DOA, 2nd board - Bad South Bridge within 2 months, 3rd board - Bad DIMM slot after 6 months, 4th board - Bad DIMM slot after 3 months. The quality of this board it terrible. Now to the worst part of the experience.....the customer support!! The last replacement was a total nightmare by far, not like the others were good either, but this last time took the cake. I opened an RMA for replacement and explained the issue along with my concern for the quality of the product. I requested a NIB instead of a repaired refurb like I received all of the other times I opened a case. After a week of hearing nothing from an ASUS rep, I used the chat to see what was going on and got nowhere. I then decided to call instead and talk with someone and still got nowhere. After finally getting somewhere, my request for a NIB replacement was approved by a ASUS supervisor. Then the wait game occurred again where I received no contact from ASUS. I decide to call in again. While on the phone on hold, FedEx delivers a box to my house from ASUS. I open the box only to find that ASUS sent me a refurb board instead of the new board I was approved to receive. Nice try ASUS trying to shut me up with a refurb. To help you understand the time line so far, this is the end of 3 weeks from when my case was opened. After lots of calls, my case has made it to level 3 (ASUS Corporate Customer Care) about my issue. They tried to deny my approved request of a NIB replacement and asked for me to provide info to them of where I was approved of the NIB replacement. Only after digging it all up and sending the info to them, they agreed to send it to me the NIB replacement I was told I would receive. I have yet to receive my replacement NIB unit from them and its going on 2 months. So far this process has cost me close to 10k in SLA's with customers that have dropped me as a provider and countless thousands to others that have stayed by me through this process. Unfortunately, I don't have a backup server that would have made this a seamless process cause I only due this on the side of my already everyday IT job. I have even consulted with a lawyer over this circle jerk with ASUS. Unfortunately, I can't bill my customers for a service I can't provide. I'm still paying for it to this day. The only compensation they offered me for this HUGE hit in my wallet, is to extend my warranty 6 months from my purchase date along with overnight shipping. WOW, NOW THAT'S CUSTOMER SERVICE!!!!!

I assumed he knew what he was doing so i bought the recovery disks for 50 dollars. Insane price. So it prompted me to put in my laptop serial number at checkout to make sure i get the proper software. When i got the disks it said windows 7 on them but my laptop came preinstalled with windows 8 so i called the Asus order support right after. The tech told me that i can install the windows 7 recovery disks on my laptop so i trusted him and tried it but it didn't work because it kept looping the booting process. So I decided to talk to a Microsoft tech and he told me all I needed was a windows 10 iso tool and install it on my laptop. After trying this it finally worked. He said i didn't even need the recovery disks. I don't know if the asus tech knew that I didn't have to buy the recovery disks but I just felt like I've been scammed. They also don't take refunds for softwares so I just lost 50 dollars that could've been used for microsoft office.

After various contact with the agent they said that they found the MB defective and will replace it. This all the electronic components of the laptop is replaced.

169,4/10/16 6:26AM,"Hello,
I bought an ASUS X550J recently, and realised it ran into a problem upon booting (Driver state power failure). So I went over to the ASUS service center for checking and repair of the laptop at Capital Piazza, Singapore, on the 27th March 2016

The first part of the service was good. The staff was quite friendly. The problem lies with the process of collection

The service staff said that I would get my computer within 5-7 days of giving it to them for repair, and that they would call/send a message upon completion However, I did not receive any message or call as to whether my laptop was ready by the 4th of April, so I called the ASUS service center, and found out that my computer needed a motherboard change, and the parts were not in Singapore yet. That I understand, that there may be delays in shipments. However, I believe the company could do better by at least sending a message to inform me of the delay.

However, what made me really disappointed was the fact that when I receive back the laptop, which was on the 9th April, and I checked it in front of the service staff, it had only 4GB of ram. I gave them the laptop with 12GB of ram. I know that ASUS prides yourselves with high quality testing of your laptops, so I am very disappointed with the handling of the repairs, and I question whether you really check the laptops before giving it to the customers after repairs. Anyway, they repaired it and said it was that they did not put the ram back in properly, so it was loose. They tightened it afterwards, and it was fine.

What really frustrates me and makes me utterly disappointed with your service center is when I went back, the moment I took the laptop out, the bottom cover, which houses the storage of RAM and all the important components, dropped out. It wasn't screwed back in at all. The technician simply put it back but did not screw. I would not speculate as to whether he forgot about it, or he did it on purpose. Both screws were nowhere to be found. I am seriously disappointed with your service.

All I want now is to know which type of screw do I need to get to screw back the cover for the X550J laptop.

I would be glad if you could at least fulfill this request.

Thank You.",neg

He was terrible. After at least an hour of trying various things, he said there is nothing wrong with the router but there is a problem with my computer and I should call Dell.

I had a fit, said this was a cop out and he couldn't leave me high and dry-----it also didn't work on my second computer or on my Ipad so obviously this was either the fault of the router or I was not installing it correctly. So he said let's start all over, I had depower everything for 3 minutes and meanwhile he said he'd put the call on hold.

185,3/6/16 4:52AM,"Following an issue with a new battery on an ASUS G73J I opened a call early January in France where I bought the machine. The call center there finally agreed that it was a known problem on this kind of PCs (apparently an issue at the level of the connector on the motherboard) and accepted to have the machine returned and repaired under RMA. When I tried to organise the return it was not possible to have the machine picked in Belgium for a repair in France. ASUS then
asked me to turn to the NL/BE call center and to explain the case: which I did.
Rather than consulting FR repair center or referring to the existing ASUS case ID opened in
France, ASUS NL decided to start the procedure again from scratch to finally come to a
different conclusion than the one of the french technicians and refused the return of the PC.
ASUS is therefore unable to have a pan european policy on defects and returns. A decision taken in one repair center should be acknowledged in any ASUS return center and implemented without any further discussion everywhere else in the world ( or at least in Europe). In addition it is difficult accepting that a company like ASUS is not able to acknowledge responsibilty for recurrent and known defects on some models (like the one affecting my machine today) and do not systematically accept to repair those at its own expense (The FR repair center recognised it). The same treatment should be applied to all customers as it seems, that for the same fault, ASUS proposed repairs for free outside the guarantee period.
This issue not being the first one with Asus repair centers I have decided that for the future replacements of my machines I will now turn to competitors and this despite having been, until now, a very faithful and good ASUS client (I so far bought 3 laptops including the ROG at stake
here which is a rather expensive machine, one tablet and several mother boards).",neg

213,1/10/16 9:30AM,"I purchased two ASUS Transformer Book Flip TP300L laptops a few weeks before Christmas, one for my son and one for my daughter. Around a week and a half before Christmas I removed the brand new laptops from their boxes and proceeded to connect the laptops to our wireless Internet, install an antivirus program, and run any updates the laptops might need. What I found was one of the laptops worked just fine and the other laptop sounded like the fan was constantly running. What I found in addition to the fan noise was an incomplete build after checking device manager and seeing so many devices not recognized. After calling ASUS tech support and restoring the operating system it was determined that the best thing to do was to send it in for service. So no laptops for my kids at Christmas, which we planned for due to shipping being hit or miss during the Christmas season, and received the repaired laptop today, Monday December 28 2015. I removed the laptop from the bubble wrap and placed it on my desk. I was very irritated at how the laptop looked. I saw tape residue on the top of the laptop and then I opened the laptop only to see more tape residue, and an actual piece of tape, stuck to the screen. I then noticed that the screw covers were warped and also noticed a dime-sized discoloration on the back-right of the keyboard that looks like a heat mark. So I cleaned up the laptop and screen and noticed that there are scratch marks on the hinges that hold the screen onto the laptop. This is supposed to be a new laptop. I double-checked the serial number with the one on the box just to make sure it was the same laptop, and it is. I then boot the laptop and went into device manager to see if there are any devices that are not recognized. For the most part things are good except for the touchpad, which is set to Microsoft PS/2 Mouse, and that driver might be the reason that the touch pad is erratic. The laptop is also extremely slow in installing and uninstalling software...on an i5 processor with 6GB of RAM. After checking Event Viewer I noticed an entry pointing to system firmware not being updated enough for the processor speed to be realized. I removed two separate, identical pieces of software from both laptops at the same time and the one that WAS NOT sent in for repair accomplished this at a much faster rate. At this point I regret buying an ASUS. A 50% average sucks when you are talking about computer products. Right now, I am 4+ hours waiting for this laptop to install updates. This is the second time I watched this laptop install this amount of updates. An hour and a half ago it was 111 updates, now it is 110. BTW I have Verizon Fios 50MB Internet connectivity, so it's not the connection speed. Since I am a glutton for punishment I called ASUS tech support and asked if they could assist me in updating my laptop firmware. I figured it's the least they could do since the ""repaired"" laptop came back without the latest firmware. After a few minutes the tech support rep stated that he couldn't assist me, that I would need to visit their site and do it on my own. I will not buy another ASUS laptop if for any other reason than for their laughable tech support. I then called tech support back and asked that they assist me in updating the firmware, and gave them the Event Viewer details, and the next thing I know is I'm on the phone with a representative from Microsoft support. So I ask her for help and inform her of the background of my issue. She tells me that I need to see a local tech support person face to face. OMG I'm about to lose it at this point. So I call ASUS support back and I hear the phone pick up, then I hear people talking in the background, and then I am forwarded to a survey. After filling out the survey I call back again, and I get another survey. I call back again on my cell phone because at this point my home wireless phone battery is dead. I can't remember the exact time but I do remember telling the technician that I'm going on 6+ hours with this laptop. The technician informed me that resetting the laptop will hopefully resolve the issues, and that I would lose everything with the reset. I'm fine with it, but I tell him that before I sent the laptop back for repair the first technician had me do the reset and it did nothing to resolve the issue. So here I am, 6+ hours into it already and I know the system restore is going to take hours. I stay up for it...its past 2:30AM and I can't take it anymore. I get a few hours of sleep and wake up around 7AM and check on the reset. It looks like it finished but I am still seeing the same Event Viewer entries and experience the same system sluggishness. Maybe the Windows update is causing the slowness? No...I had the same exact laptop right next to this one and had no issue with sluggishness at all. Of course I didn't see the Event Viewer entries in the other laptop. Windows is downloading updates so I let it download and run them. Windows reboots and hangs. I let the process go on for around 2 hours and then I cold boot. Windows is now screwed up, so I go and do another reset. It is now 1:55PM and I just gave my son this laptop because he has been patiently waiting to get his Christmas present. This laptop has issues. I bought this laptop brand new and it has never worked as it should out of the box...it has never worked as it should upon return from ""repair""...and after resetting/reloading Windows not once but twice it is still having issues. I believe we're past the point of fixing this laptop, as it obviously has issues that can't be fixed with driver updates or operating system restores. In addition to all of this, I copy MS Office directly onto the C drive and run setup and it ran so slowly that I left it run overnight. 7 hours later the next morning I get up to check the install and it is still frozen at the same point in the install. At this point I sent an email to ASUS corporate office respectfully ask for a replacement laptop or a department where I can actually send my complaint. I don't expect anything to come of this...I sure do with I would have read the company reviews before I bought the laptops.",neg

218,1/6/16 12:28PM,"Hi,

Severe harassment by Service Center executives especially by Arun Kumar from F1 Info Solutions & Services Private Limited, Bangalore (Sigma Mall Unit) and another lady receptionist. I gave my Nexus 7 tablet for repair on 23rd Dec, 2015 and I received a mail that my tablet has been repaired and i received a few calls from the customer care and service center informing the same and they simply asked me to come and collect the product. Since i had gone out of station, I went on 6th Jan, 2016 to collect the product. When they asked me for the acknowledgement, i said i left the copy at home and showed them the mail which they sent as proof for the same. I also had the invoice copy of the purchased product and all other necessary documents. Instead of giving the product the service center person, Arun Kumar started abusing me stating that they cannot give the product even if i have the mail as proof. I spoke to the Asus Customer care and they too spoke to this guy to give the product to me but he still refused to give it. Instead i had to go the nearby police station to file a FIR stating that i had given the tablet for repair to the service center. After i came with the FIR, Arun Kumar started abusing me again stating that i will not get tablet immediately and will need to wait for the other people who had during my absence when i had to go to the police station and the court to file the FIR and affidafit. This is the worst experience and customer service anybody could receive and the severe harassment caused to the customer should be dealt on a special note. I hope this feedback is taken on a serious note so that customers like me do suffer such harassment in future. The person even threatened me that i cannot do anything to me and no complaint can be filed or action will be taken against him. I am surely going to raise this matter on other social networking platform too until justice is done and action is taken against Arun Kumar and the front row receptionist.",neg

I bought my ASUS Zenfone last September 2015 at the Ambassador Store, Glorietta Branch - Makati, Philippines. During 1st week November 2015, my phone charger suddenly stopped charging so I went to Ambassador Store for repair and replacement. They referred me to another store, Gigahertz, also in Glorietta as they are the ones in charge of receiving defective units.


Gigahertz accepted the unit and told me to expect a response in 2-3 weeks. It was already 1st week December and I have not received any feedback from them. I continuously followed up my issue with them until finally they provided me with a C/N approval for my unit. They told me to present the C/N approval to Ambassador store as it is where i bought my product. To my frustration they are not aware of the process for the C/N and I had to wait for hours just for them to contact their office. Unfortunately, they cannot confirm what to do and I had to leave the store.

I then contacted, MSI, which is the company who issued the C/N. Initially they were helpful but soon the responses were already delayed. It seems they are not also aware of the process in the store. so I already took the initiative to coordinate with MSI and Ambassador. I am the one arranging the issue myself to get both parties coordinated!

242,12/18/15 4:50AM,"Hi,
Can you help me understand the issue behind my ASUS Zenfone 5 problem?
I purchased the unit in SM Sta. Mesa Manila Philippines in Dec 24, 2014 for my Mother who only uses the phone for calls only.
In Oct 2015, she complained that she cannot hear the other party from the phone, e.g. Problem in earpiece.
Since I don't have the time to seek repair for the unit which is still under warranty, I bought her an ASUS Zenfone GO ( Im really a fan of ASUS) instead.
Yesterday, I went to GIGAHERTZ North EDSA Quezon City Service Center for repair, then today, the Technician, Mr Jun Mar Dela Cruz told me that the warranty is VOID because the unit was Water Damaged. I am really surprised as my Mother took care of the unit very well, it is always with protective cover and she always keeps it in her purse, so she herself is surprise to be informed of the water that damaged the phone.
I asked the Technician, why did he say it was water damage, Jun told me that there is this mobile part - LDI Indicator (part of sub board) which is originally colored WHITE, and once it changed color (turned into RED), that will indicate that the unit was WATER DAMAGED.
I need your technical expertise and honest opinion, as to when does the LDI Indicator color changed?
Any other reason when their color would changed?
I believe this is not Customer Negligence, my mother confirmed that the unit never immersed in water.
I like your product, it is cheap and specs are incredible.
But with this kind of customer after sales service, even without customer negligence, why is it that our warranty is void. This is beyond our control, is this how ASUS warranty works in other country as well.
There are a number of bogus, and hokus pokus happening here in Philippines, I just don't know if I am a victim now. Because we need to pay Gigahertz with Php 1,500 now, even if this is still cover with the 1 year warranty. Pls. Note that this is Christmas Season.
I never encountered problem like this in APPLE nor in NOKIA service warranty.
Please Help me understand. If this is how your warranty works worldwide.
We are confident that 1 year warranty holds, but in this case, we are penalized without our knowledge nor negligence.

If the technician analysis is wrong, could you help correct this kind of service in the Philippines.
At least verify with them and re-trained them. This is creating Bad Image to your company.

If this kind of service cannot be corrected, then Im afraid, That I will stop patronizing your product because of poor service and poor technical analysis.

Thank you for your time.",neg

245,12/16/15 1:45PM,"Dear Sir/Madam,
I have serious problems with ASUS Turkey. First of all I know ASUS for 20 years and I use many components like desktop graphic card, desktop mainboards and notebook. But ASUS Turkey left a question mark in my mind about the last serious problem.
I bought ASUS N53SV-SX182V notebook on 16 April 2011. I had a problem with DC Connection Card on 05 June 2012. The ASUS Turkey's Technical Service changed the DC Connection Card. But I encountered the same problem on 20 November 2015. I sent the notebook to technical service again (my warranty was finished). They informed that my X4 mainboard was burned and it had to be changed a new one. They bided 380$ for mainboard and 25$ for labor cost. I reminded that I sent it again 3 years ago and DC Connection Card was changed by them. Consequently they gave me 35$ discount. I requested sending my notebook to me without any repair.
When I received the notebook, I took it to a private computer service in Sinop. They examined the notebook and determined that my mainboard wasn't burned and had a problem with my DC Connection Card again!!!. They changed the DC Connection Card. My notebook is running properly now. I informed the ASUS Turkey about the case. Their answer aggravated the situation. They said ""changing DC Connection Card was not a permanent solution"". Why was mainboard not changed at the first time (in warranty time)? It means that when the component is out of warranty, you try to cheat your client!!!

Also I have a second problem. When I entered my ASUS information, I mentioned my sexual status as a woman but they addressed all writings as a man. I think that they don't care any information about customers. Why do you demand the information about people if you don't care????
I believed that ASUS was a trusted company. After all, how can I trust ASUS? I would like to specify that I will arraign you to Turkish consumer court by materially and morally.",neg

However, I was told the rebate was being looked into and that I would receive a response/update. I never received a response, never mind the rebate.

The demeanor of the customer service rep and the lack of a follow-up angered me more than not receiving the rebate. When I sent in a subsequent email asking why I did not receive a response, I received this message in reply:

""Thank You for contacting ASUS Reward Center. We apologize for the inconvenience. Please contact our customer service number at 1-888-820-8964 on Mon. - Fri. 9:00am - 6:00pm (EST) and our customer service representatives will be happy to assist you. Thank you for your email.""

With that said, I purchased a laptop on Black Friday special for a ridiculous price and wanted to upgrade the memory from 4GB to 8GB. I wasn't sure of the memory configuration and since it was a gift didn't want to open it, rather find out what part I needed and purchase it. I went to support.asus.com and looked at the emanual technicial documentation and there was no mention of the RAM configuration. I then proceeded to contact Asus support and spoke with an agent that requested the model#, serial#, etc. He came back and told me it was populated with one 4GB module with one empty bank. I then turn to newegg.com and purchase a 4GB module. Come to find out, it only handles one module. I'm now out my time and money because Asus support can't answer a simple product technical question about their product. After requesting them to make the situation right, they avoid all blame and accountability and say they are sorry. In my opinion, that doesn't cut it. I've dealt with other companies that made mistakes and jumped through hoops to make the situation right. Not Asus! Those companies that take care of me as a customer have someone that will buy many products from them in the future.

When I saw the specifications and price of their new desktop, M32CD, I was convinced to purchase it. My reason for buying a desktop is that I wish to configure it with an SSD, and additional HD, and increase the memory. In order to do this properly it would help to have a technical manual so that I do it properly. I would expect this manual to contain a motherboard layout and also explain the BIOS options. I checked their support site and found there was only a User Guide without this information.

I made several attempts to find this information, the text chat on their site, a telephone call, and I downloaded their android service app and called again. The answer I finally received was that ASUS has a policy that they don't want customers to add components, or change the factory configuration in any way and therefore will not release this information.


Manuals with this information are provided by other manufactures and its only reasonable for a customer to expect this. Many customers that buy a tower desktop intend to eventually upgrade it.

I noticed a problem with it immediately and sent it back. I payed nearly $1000AU and expected an exchange. Instead, your company put in new glass and returned the same unit back to me. The glass was replaced so poorly it literally looked like your techs had used a can opener to prise the original glass from it.

I'm posting here again after receiving an encouraging message from Asus, asking me to contact them so that we could work something out with this failed laptop. Turns out, it was a generic email address, and I sent my grievances to another random support staffer, who glanced over the entire body of my email to simply suggest providing a receipt proving that my laptop is within the 1-year warranty period.




Here's me story, I spoke to two different tech support staff and they both quoted a repair price significantly lower than what I'd later receive. I was completely mislead to send my laptop in for a $210 motherboard replacement (plus $100 in shipping) when the invoice later became $745.

I've received some official apologies for the inconvenience, (it took over a month to go through the process of having my unrepaired laptop returned after I couldn't afford the repair bill that was over 3x the quoted price) but Asus is absolving itself of any responsibility since I'm beyond the warranty period.



If you'd like to peruse a list of disgruntled Asus customers that have suffered the same issues, with the same faulty motherboard, feel free to go through this list:




It's very clear that there's been a consistent issue, but Asus insists on leaving its users to pay exorbitant repair bills to return their products to proper working order.



I really didn't expect a high-end laptop to have a life cycle of little over a year, especially when I've maintained the fans, kept it on a cooling pad and have taken good care of it.







ASUS, please stop attempting to make your company look good by replying to these customer complaints, unless you're actually offering something other than apologies and excuses. Your business practices are shameful.",neg
262,11/23/15 8:40PM,"I bought a tablet a year ago in 2014.This was due to how highly a friend mentioned of
your company and of his tablet. It worked great at first. Then the usb dock on the

keyboard started randomly not working. For a while it wouldn't work at all. I stopped
using it. The tablet then starting having charging issues, where it would be charging,
then die within a few hours, not being used at all. I sent it in on RMA uspc5a2066.
this rma process was a joke, You received it on 10/23/15, starting working on it on
10/26/15 and then finally sent me a replacement unit after it was determined that
some part between the usb and the battery wasn't available. This happened on Nov
9th. I received the tablet on Nov 11th. 2 hours later, the unit was broken and I was
creating another rma, (USX35B0777). I ran through the setup process, it then asked
to do a system update, that went fine, It then asked to do another system update.
Odd but ok, it stopped there and wouldn't turn on. I contacted support who stated it
looks like hardware. the next day I went to do some further troubleshooting from
support and it wouldnt even appear to power on. This is the same results as what the
orignal unit had happen. The rma arrived at your facility on 11/17/15

I am so disappointed in this entire process, The original rma case went beyond the 5-7 days. I didn't find out what happened on the rma till I created a complaint ticket. Then it went another 6 days
before I received my tablet back. Then to have both units appear to be hardware. Now, this rma hasn't even been checked in for repair yet. It has been 6 days sitting in receiving. Who knows how long it will be to get it fixed and back to me. I am told nothing other than when I either call or create a worthless complaint ticket. Horribly disappointed.

263,11/20/15 3:41AM,"Hi,
I would adamantly NOT recommend either Asus products or service.
We bought 2 Asus T100 transformers. The first was last year: it collapsed after two months, had to be returned for service whereupon the screen was replaced, and now, just a year later the battery appears to be going (it needs charging after 2 hours...).

The second was purchased in February this year. In September the battery went, so was sent off for service. That took 2 weeks. Three days later it froze, and had to be returned yet again. for nearly 3 weeks. Each time pick up and drop off had to be arranged. The email exchange on the matter is below -- but ultimately the response was go to the service website if you need it serviced --- which is what the complaint was about!!!!!
There does not appear to be a proper customer service department anywhere in the world, in which you can speak to someone with authority; just these daft websites and a technician at the end of a phone.
I have been using computers of various brands for over 20 years and I have never -- ever!! -- had such hardware problems.
Not only is this a massive waste of time and money, but it means I now have to go and find a real tablet and computer.

The Asus T200 comes full of stickers : ' plays well with windows 10' etc.
My first T200 could not update to Win10 as it said it needed 6Gb (of a 32Gb disc - half seems to be partitioned for recovery - not sure what I can clear down).
After 2 weeks, the charging port (or something) seemed to fail and wouldn't take a charge. So it was returned for replacement.
The second unit also wanted to update (as do I , since, apart from a specific freezing issue, I love Win10 on my main laptop). Since this one says it has just over 6Gb free , I thought it a good idea (and hoped it would delete Win 8 to make room for other apps).

called Asus warranty support, they issued RMA, but I need to pack my machine and I should pay to ship them back(in contrast to many warranty service). I asked will I be responsible for the charge of shipping back. Clearly more than three times, they told me that Asus will be responsible for shipping back at Asus cost.
Four days after they received, I got an email with invoice of
1. $320 to replace LCD
2. $10 to ship back.
Asus used some defective LCD on some small screens. Their tablet has tons of LCd issue and they finally decided to replace those. My machine is under normal usage. No physical damage at all. Screen glass is still perfect. but they decline the warranty service.

Now itwas already 15 days ,still they were unable to rectify the problem.



The problem i came to know from the service guys is MOTHER BOARD DAMAGED.and they have given a dead line that the same will be received by 12th November.But today when i called the service and call center they were not in a position to give the correct date.



My question to you is ASUS IS PROCLAIMED AS SOFTWARE AND HARDWARE GAINT, then why this unnecessary situation you were creating,Just it is matter of one day to ship the hardware from Taiwan/Singapore.If really there is scarcity of hardware then why don't ASUS replace my Fone.



If ASUS fails on after sales service.Then this could be a major setback on your brand value which inturn a wrong publicity among the customers.Already this publicity has started and to detain it further you have to act on warfooting.

But withing a few weeks it starts misbehaving, whithin 5 months it is dead.

I tried explaining this to tech-support many times, talked to the supervisor on duty, and had the problem sent to the escalation department. Several of these people have agreed that I would be happier (and ASUS would save a bundle) if they jsut replaced the thing.

The problem is that all they seem to be able to do is issue another RMA and let the technicians decide. And those guys just ""fix"" it to their satisfaction and the cycle restarts.

The company seems absolutely incapable of looking at the history and considering the problem as a whole: it's one repair at a time.

350,8/22/20 10:02AM,Good afternoon to whom it concerns I am drafting this email on behalf of Fitzroy B. who was my customer service representative on 8/22/2020; his service was by far this most pleasurable experience I have ever received from a customer service representative from any company. I was having trouble with my new ROG STRIX and I inquired about whether or not my BIOS was up to date and after no time my service agent Mr. Fitzroy was able to determine that the BIOS was in fact out of date. He not only waited 20 plus minutes for me to drive to the store and get the flash drive needed to do the update but he even call me back twice because the signal dropped as he explained you all were going through some changes with the technology being used to support the customers. The total call took about two hours as he helped me to understand a lot of stuff about my new computer; he even emailed me plenty of information regarding how to do various tasks within the BIOS and overall functionality of the computer. I am very satisfied with his service and he is the standard of what customer service should be like in every way. I also noted that when he didn't know something he didn't hesitate to inform me of that and work hard and quick to look up the correct information and direct me from there showing a remarkable level of candidacy and integrity. Thank you ASUS support team you all ROCK!,pos

376,10/22/19 5:26PM,"I have spent much of the last three days trying to get better wifi signal throughout my house...
A few weeks back, I called ASUS for their recommendations regarding this topic.. unfortunately, it was recommended that I purchase ASUS repeaters... which I did... but despite numerous attempts (some VERY prolonged), by well-meaning people, we could not get these to work.
Ultimately, I was put in touch with Patrick, one of your senior techs...
For one thing, he suggested an AiMesh solution would make more sense... and I spent a few hours yesterday purchasing two compatible ASUS routers (to work as nodes to my main router). I returned the two, dysfunctional repeaters to NewEgg and am fearful they will charge me a restocking fee.
In any case, Patrick literally spent hours trying to get my new nodes up and running... and finally did! He was patient, professional, and kind. Despite numerous dropped calls (?my phone), he kept calling back and made it clear that he would get the job done. He deserves a lot of credit for ""righting the wrongs"" that had preceded him.

My situation was a bit of a problem since the previous agent did not provide the right solution and we had to redo the whole process. I was installing two RT-N66U routers, with one as a repeater. The process took a while due to other network conflicts Shawn had to figure out.

His patience and instruction clarity was admirable, but mostly, his knowledge was exceptional! Please extend to him my sincerest thank you and honor him and salute his for his good work. I wish every support professional was as good as Shawn!

I really commend this team because the amount empathy really shown through the time and dedication. I TRULY TRULY believe that Nicholas. D needs a raise because sometime customer agents deal with a fluster customer that's been past off from agent to agent and sometime they don't want to hear from the current agent ( no offense), but they prefer to hear from someone with the actual tools to make the changes higher up.

Kyle H., my live chat customer svc.rep was beyond amazing. He was patient and persistent and deeply knowledgeable and easy to follow and encouraging. I lost my password to my notebook. I had to do a factory reset but the first recovery procedure didn't work. Then the second recovery procedure also didn't work. Then we have to go into advanced bios options to disable fast bios boot or something like that in order to be able to go back and try those recovery procedures again. But first disabling the fast bios boot didn't even work! And at each of these junctures Kyle did not give up. He kept patiently giving me next steps to execute until finally we were able to disable the fast Boot and then go all the way back and the original recovery procedure then worked! I kept waiting for him to say I'm sorry I can't help you any further and he did just the opposite at every juncture.

My ASUS notebook had received a Windows update that caused the keyboard to no longer function ... LOUTIAN H. was extremely knowledgeable and proficient at guiding me through the necessary steps to correct the problem.




It took about an hour or hour and a half to eventually reach resolution but he was patient and methodical in each and every step until success was achieved.



I want you to know he is an asset to your organization and possesses the exact combination of technical and interpersonal skills that you need in your technical support people ... please pass along my sincere appreciation to LOUTIAN H. for a job very well done.

438,9/17/18 9:25AM,"Hello,

As a Global IT Project Manager, I find myself being critical of other's Support Service organizations. I rarely find myself praising the service of others as it is what they are paid to do.

With that said, I am compelled to offer feedback on Johnoy S. and his addressing and satisfying my support needs when I had a very frustrating issue with my Asus AT-5300 router. During the call, he demonstrated outstanding listening skills and allowed me to summarize the issues I was experiencing, without interruption. This was very important it allowed him to glean information from me that actually help him understand the issue and thereby formulate his approach as to how to determine the root cause and ultimate resolution.


He was very patient, even when I was somewhat frustrated.

I will end this feedback with the strongest statement I can make. I would hire Johnoy S. on my Support Team without hesitation.

It is the gold standard support that Asus delivers that is a point of differentiation when it comes to me making a hardware purchase decision. Well done Johnoy S. and Asus!",pos

449,7/14/18 7:34AM,"This letter is written to the management of Asus responsible for Customer Issues.

My comments originate from an interaction with one of your Customer Care Representatives name Stephan P.

The essence is this:
Solving the customers problem, while being the first half of the service being provided, is greatly influenced by the second half of the service.
That second half is in making the customer feel good through authentic interaction.

For example, I called Asus because my Serial Number did not work when I attempted to respond to a request for it. Stephan P found the
Answer in minimal time. I had made a mistake and had forgotten a letter. That is the first half.

But the second half was that he sensed I was embarrassed. In my mind that mistake revealed something about my character that I did not like.
Through calm and easy exchange of conversation, which might be perceived as a waste of time since the conversation was not aimed at solving
""the customer's problem""....I began to relax and feel better. Who knows what he said. What mattered is that he recognized the problem was more
than the serial number. It was also about me leaving Asus feeling good about myself. Stephan P. did that.

I hope the management at Asus is astute enough to recognize that the human part should be included in customer care (as Stephan P did). That may
be difficult as Asus is derived out of engineering excellence and the stereo type image of an engineer is to not be socially adept.

Perhaps an executive might take the time to visit Stephan personally. No need for awards or communal praise. Just quietly go and adjust
One's posture to make the executive's eyes at the same level as the eyes of Stephan P. and thank him for exceptional service. For going
Beyond.

Respectfully,
Bil",pos

I called the ASUS product support phone line today about difficulty I was having making adjustments to my refurbished ASUS monitor. I was having difficulty discerning how the adjustment controls work and I was unable to make adjustments to the contrast, brightness and other settings. The gentleman I first spoke to told me his name when he came on the line but I did not write it down and don't recall it now. For that I am sorry. But he was VERY patient and helpful. He patiently walked me through the process of making image adjustments on screen and helped me to understand how the buttons at the bottom of the monitor have different functions depending upon where you are in a given menu. (That had been the source of my difficulty.) Once I understood that, I remembered that I had previously tried to download a users manual for this monitor from the ASUS website but discovered it only downloaded from the website in the form of a ""RAW"" file, which I could not open. It was not available as a PDF file (or any other format I could open.) He want to that page of the website himself and discovered that was in fact the case but he did not have access to a program to open or convert a RAW file either. It was at that point he transferred my call to Aaron C., his supervisor. Upon my request Aaron agreed he would download the RAW file himself, convert it to a PDF file and email it to me, which he did within a matter of a few minutes.



I consider this to be exceptionally good customer service on the part of both of these gentlemen and I would like to thank and commend both of them. I apologize to the first gentleman I spoke to for not remembering his name, but I hope you can determine who he is from my case number [CASE NO=N1802132514].

First let me congratulate whoever hired this young lady. You found a real ""GEM"".

I have dealt with many tech support personnel in my 32 years in heavily using computers in my businesses.

By far Chevelle ranks in the TOP 3 of the hundreds I have dealt with.

First, she knows here product, WOW does she know her product. Probably better that the president of ASUS.

Second, she is highly professional.

Third, she is very friendly.

Fourth, she maintains composure when things just are not working.

If I were the HR Director I would make sure this young lady stays and grows with ASUS.

Her potential is ""off-the-chart""

This comes from a man who has been an entrepreneur for 50 years and has started and run a number of successful businesses.

Show her some appreciation. Take her to lunch; give her an Amazon gift card.

505,2/6/18 6:34PM,"Most recent experience with ASUS customer support was very well handled and they took a good amount of time to understand the situation and work through it until resolved. It was a relatively complex, uncommon situation that in the end, turned out to not even be an issue with the ASUS motherboard BIOS. But, they made sure that it finally was resolved and even called back to ensure that everything was working.

I've generally had very professional and responsive customer support from ASUS and would not hesitate to continue to use their products.",pos

The next morning I checked my email and to discover that he had hyperlinked direct downloads for my board, and also the software I needed to update My bios. I found that my experience with ASUS support was prompt, clearly understood what the problem was, and quickly resolved.

528,11/24/17 10:55AM,"If you are lucky enough to reach Shantelle S at ASUS customer service, I believe I can safely say that your customer service experience will be far above par. Shantelle LISTENED to my issues with their laptop. She didn't come up with ridicules explanations how the issue was my problem on a 6 month old laptop and was RMA'd once and then returned to ASUS 2 days after the first RMA for the problem not having been corrected. Actually, more importantly, the second RMA event showed that my laptop was not damaged. It appears to have been dropped. Shantelle researched with my the possibilities why my laptop was damaged and we explored that it could have been FedEx or during unpacking at ASUS. For sure it was not damaged when I sent it. I had no problem pursuing FedEx for the repair costs, but wanted to proof that the box it arrived in was damaged. Or for us to watch the video of ASUS unpacking my laptop. In both cases, Shantelle, understood and took appropriate actions to honor the warranty and repair the laptop including the new damage correctly. I am a long time ASUS advocate and have been purchasing their equipment for personal and business use for many, many years. The quality of the products does appear to have dropped over recent years. I understand that equipment won't last forever and sometimes comes off the assembly line poorly, but I will not tolerate poor customer service. If ASUS continues to hire the Shantelles out there and supports their products, I will remain a long time customer.",pos

534,11/14/17 2:39PM,"I recently purchased an ASUS router (RT-AC1200). I followed the instructions when setting it up, or so I thought, but when I went to use it...no joy. I tried to go back following the original instructions to change my sign in name and password, but the site wouldn't accept anything I entered. So this past Monday I called your technical department (I believe that's what it's called) and had the good fortune to speak with Mario2 M. I explained to Mario the issue I was having and he patiently spent the better part of an hour walking me through the following:

1. Step by step process to gain access to establishing a new sign in name and password.


2. Step by step process I need to follow if I needed access the site to make any changes in the future.

3. Step by step process to delete my previous wi-fi set up in order to set up my new wi-fi. This was necessary because I attempted to name my new wi-fi set up the same as my previous one. Apparently that's a no no.

4. I'm sure there's a few other things he helped me with, but I don't remember them at the moment.

But the most important thing I would like ASUS and his supervisor(s) know is that I believe Mario went far exceeded my expectations in helping me to set up my router. Throughout he was patient, courteous, professional, extremely knowledgeable and more than understanding of the frustration I was having. I can't sing his praises enough, but I do know this. Of the many customer service people I have had to speak with over the years, Mario is by far the best I've ever encountered. He is a definite asset to ASUS. If only more companies took the time to train their customer service personnel as ASUS obviously has, there'd be a lot more satisfied and repeat customers. In fact, I was even looking at an ASUS laptap today based simply on the positive experience I've had with your company.

In closing, please extend my heartfelt thanks to Mario2 M for a job well done. If ASUS has an outstanding customer service personnel awards, he has definitely deserves one.

Feel free to contact me if you require additional information.

Regards,

John Bennett",pos

547,10/9/17 3:19PM,"To whom in may concern.

This morning, after trying every which way, I gave up and decided to make a call for help. This turned out to be my best decision of the day. From the first moment, after getting answers to all necessary questions from me, Mr Orville took couple moments to describe the step by step analysis he intended to follow. His was not a fishing expedition but well calculated and planned solution that was executed one-step-a time resulting with The Solution. He fixed my router problem and made it possible for me to proceed with my task. Along the process, he kept me in the loop. What turned out to be was an unusual condition that could only be discovered by someone with his knowledge, expertise and experience and most importantly his confidence that happen to be the constant link with him and his client.

I would appreciate if this message could be included his personnel records. As a long time retired manager, I owe him this service. Mr. Orville helped me to believe that there still are dignity and care.
