      "['53', '8/27/18 1:11PM', \"I bought an ASUS notebook on 22.05.2017 in Lisboa, Portugal. With a few months of active and consistent use, the notebook began to function improperly for a few months, shutting itself down and restarting the system randomly (sometimes with a spacing of several weeks due to the little use it was given in the meantime) and interrupting abruptly important work calls via Skype, among other operations. I waited until the 4th \\\\ 5th occurrence until I was sure that it was indeed a malfunction of the laptop and not any restart due to an update of the operating system. After this last occurrence (on January 2018), during which the sound of the notebook became a loud noise and after which the notebook turned off, I decided to go directly to ASUS (in my home country Portugal) to solve the situation.\\nThe laptop came back with an unsatisfactory diagnostic report. No anomaly had been detected. As soon as I got home and tested the laptop, I noticed that the sound of it had worsened. Poor sound quality, although random, was more frequent. Extremely dissatisfied, I then decided to go to the shop where I had bought my computer directly (FNAC), explaining my previous situation with the technical support services of ASUS, to which I had submitted a formal complaint by e-mail at the time. The laptop was sent again for repair and returned without the charger (the shop was kind enough to lend me a charger until it was resent) and with the same sound problems as well as a new problem, having in the meantime turned on from suspension mode without any intervention from me (or anyone else). I returned to the shop. The notebook was resent for repair services (to ASUS).\\nAfter the 3rd shipment to repair the laptop, I tried to send a registered complaint letter addressed to ASUS. The letter was returned after giving me the wrong address by telephone. I have all the evidence regarding this episode, as well as all emails that prove the incorrect and confusing information regarding the address provided by ASUS. In the meantime, I decided to send a complaint letter through ASUS website (in Portugal) and I added an aggravating note due to the inaccuracy of the shared postal address.\\nAfter the 3rd shipment to repair the laptop, it returned with even greater problems in terms of operation. I returned the equipment again for repair and decided to resort to a Portuguese customer rights association support to resolve this situation. Subsequently, I received an email from the shop explaining that the 4th return was had the same diagnosis (nothing was wrong according to ASUS technical assistance services) and also with the aggravating factor: a diagnosis budget of 30 Euros. (no repair had been done and ASUS Portugal was asking me to pay a diagnosis budget.\\nI resent a formal complaint by letter to ASUS Portugal with a video showing the malfunction of the labtop. Someone called me and said they would take care of it (and help me) and that they would call me the following week. I have not received any call back since then (June 2018).\\nThe shop where I bought my notebook identified the same technical problem as I did and sent a video to ASUS repair assistance. I haven't had access to my laptop since January. It's almost September. ASUS Portugal hasn't fixed the problem yet (totally within the warranty - I had to return the notebook 7 months after I bought it) and they haven't contacted me yet with a solution. I also made a complaint at the shop where I bought the computer.\\nThis story seems almost unbelievable to me. I was advised by friends and at FNAC to buy the ASUS laptop in question but I am extremely dissatisfied with my purchase. I've owned computers for over 20 years and have never come across such a situation. I have never had a new computer that gave me problems in the first few months of use and I have never thought that it would be possible to have a problem and not be solved by its guarantee (in any situation or purchase made by me up to date). I bought an ASUS laptop because of its ethical production compared to other brands. It was my first experience with your brand and I am extremely sorry about it.\\nI therefore appeal to your integrity and support as a brand in order to resolve this situation as quickly as possible, in the best possible way. I am extremely dissatisfied with this situation, which has not only also made me lose a lot of time in vain as well as it has left me without my main working instrument, which is my right as your client (I have not been using the laptop for many months due to the numerous repair attempts and the notebook is formatted whenever this happens.\\nBest Regards,\\nIn&#234;s Souto Gon&#231;alves\", 'neg']\n",

I do not have a problem with the support itself as I am in IT Customer support and so understand the difficulties of the industry. My complaint is with the lack of follow through of what i was told would be done which was not and the amount of time and frustration i had to go through to have my problem actually addressed. It is ridiculous that i had to spend a week to have a hardware problem addressed when this device is being used for my work.

If you use Google, one customer representative for Asus states that there are no seals on the graphics cards - so you can\\'t even tell if your product was actually a used repackaged product.\\n\\n\\nI don\\'t mind if the lower-end graphics cards have a high DOA rate - but when you dump almost a thousand dollars into a card you should expect to see a quality product that works on the first try.

Unfortunately, you need to go through their third-party site, AsusRebates - but I still hold Asus responsible since they\\'re the ones who obviously contracted their services out to this party. The whole site is a scam. The majority of the time it\\'s offline and even certain parts of the form won\\'t load at certain times of the day. I live in an EST timezone, and I had to wake up at 3AM to complete the form online for my rebate.\\n\\nThen, you have to give all the paperwork, including cutouts of barcodes from the cardboard and printed receipts.

Any way of putting NEGATIVE Stars?\\n\\nI bought a small desktop unit and K20BF and within one day I had to call MS because there was an issue with the windows install to which MS, (surprisingly) gave a good service. We successfully fixed the issue. Next problem was the HDMI port does not send a signal to the monitor to go into sleep mode nor does it even detect the monitor (tried 2 monitors) to which I finally fixed the issue of detecting the monitor because it would only work with a generic driver. But if the computer goes off the HDMI port no longer \"talks\" to the monitor so instead of it telling it to \"sleep\" it displays a \"check your cable connection\" message, which is usually due to a video card fault of some sort. Be it as it may I accepted that too. But what I found completely and utterly absurd was when the keyboard went faulty after 1 week and 4 keys refused to work, I then hooked up another keyboard (standard TS procedure) and it worked fine. So I call Asus and the agent I spoke with, a complete jackass, first tells me he needs to put me on HOLD to find out the options available to me for a faulty keyboard. I guess a congressional meeting of the highest powers is required in order to decide something sooooooo complicated. He comes back after leaving me on hold for about 6 minutes and tells me ( and you will love this), \"You need to send in your computer.\" WTF??? I had just finished telling him that the system works fine with another keyboard but this one had 4 keys that were faulty. So I demand to speak to a supervisor. Putting aside that AGAIN, he leaves me on hold but this time for almost 20 minutes, which in call centers is taboo. I been working in call centers for 13 years and no matter how long you need to keep a customer on hold, you check in with then at a reasonable interval varying somewhere between 2 and 5 minutes depending on call center policies. Nevertheless the sup apologizes for the hold time and replies with something stupid like, \"we are unusually busy right now\". WTF does busy have to do with an agent checking in with you? He then proceeds to try to convince me that the pc has to be sent in and that if the keyboard is faulty they would repair it. NO ONE REPAIS KEYBOARDS. It\\'s NOT COST EFFECTIVE!! Again, putting all that aside, why would I want to send in a brand new computer in for a faulty keyboard? It JUST ISN\\'T DONE!!\\nStay away from Asus.

So I called Customer Service and spoke to some guy named Andre, who basically defended that it had been tested correctly and that I should buy a new one from their online store. We went around and around on the phone for over 15 minutes. Haha, what a joke. I paid almost $100 for a three year old tablet, and they couldn\\'t throw in a 50-cent piece of equipment made in China?!

There never was an \"I\\'m sorry\" or any kind of empathy... Lastly, he asked me if I wanted to take their customer service survey, and I said of course...and then I wait for over 10 minutes, and it never came on. I have a feeling he sensed I was angry and somehow blocked my ability to take the survey. So I hung up and called back, spoke to another person, and asked him if I could take the survey. He said the survey was tied to the interaction you have with the current caller, and I said that wasn\\'t my problem, that I still wanted to take the survey. He declined and said he would email me a link to a feedback page, and I could leave my comments there.

I have had a board replaced 4 times in the past year. 1st board - DOA, 2nd board - Bad South Bridge within 2 months, 3rd board - Bad DIMM slot after 6 months, 4th board - Bad DIMM slot after 3 months. The quality of this board it terrible. Now to the worst part of the experience.....the customer support!! The last replacement was a total nightmare by far, not like the others were good either, but this last time took the cake. I opened an RMA for replacement and explained the issue along with my concern for the quality of the product. I requested a NIB instead of a repaired refurb like I received all of the other times I opened a case. After a week of hearing nothing from an ASUS rep, I used the chat to see what was going on and got nowhere. I then decided to call instead and talk with someone and still got nowhere. After finally getting somewhere, my request for a NIB replacement was approved by a ASUS supervisor. Then the wait game occurred again where I received no contact from ASUS. I decide to call in again. While on the phone on hold, FedEx delivers a box to my house from ASUS. I open the box only to find that ASUS sent me a refurb board instead of the new board I was approved to receive. Nice try ASUS trying to shut me up with a refurb. To help you understand the time line so far, this is the end of 3 weeks from when my case was opened. After lots of calls, my case has made it to level 3 (ASUS Corporate Customer Care) about my issue. They tried to deny my approved request of a NIB replacement and asked for me to provide info to them of where I was approved of the NIB replacement. Only after digging it all up and sending the info to them, they agreed to send it to me the NIB replacement I was told I would receive. I have yet to receive my replacement NIB unit from them and its going on 2 months. So far this process has cost me close to 10k in SLA's with customers that have dropped me as a provider and countless thousands to others that have stayed by me through this process. Unfortunately, I don't have a backup server that would have made this a seamless process cause I only due this on the side of my already everyday IT job. I have even consulted with a lawyer over this circle jerk with ASUS. Unfortunately, I can't bill my customers for a service I can't provide. I'm still paying for it to this day. The only compensation they offered me for this HUGE hit in my wallet, is to extend my warranty 6 months from my purchase date along with overnight shipping. WOW, NOW THAT'S CUSTOMER SERVICE!!!!!

So I decided to talk to a Microsoft tech and he told me all I needed was a windows 10 iso tool and install it on my laptop. After trying this it finally worked. He said i didn't even need the recovery disks. I don't know if the asus tech knew that I didn't have to buy the recovery disks but I just felt like I've been scammed.

After various contact with the agent they said that they found the MB defective and will replace it. This all the electronic components of the laptop is replaced.

      "['213', '1/10/16 9:30AM', 'I purchased two ASUS Transformer Book Flip TP300L laptops a few weeks before Christmas, one for my son and one for my daughter. Around a week and a half before Christmas I removed the brand new laptops from their boxes and proceeded to connect the laptops to our wireless Internet, install an antivirus program, and run any updates the laptops might need. What I found was one of the laptops worked just fine and the other laptop sounded like the fan was constantly running. What I found in addition to the fan noise was an incomplete build after checking device manager and seeing so many devices not recognized. After calling ASUS tech support and restoring the operating system it was determined that the best thing to do was to send it in for service. So no laptops for my kids at Christmas, which we planned for due to shipping being hit or miss during the Christmas season, and received the repaired laptop today, Monday December 28 2015. I removed the laptop from the bubble wrap and placed it on my desk. I was very irritated at how the laptop looked. I saw tape residue on the top of the laptop and then I opened the laptop only to see more tape residue, and an actual piece of tape, stuck to the screen. I then noticed that the screw covers were warped and also noticed a dime-sized discoloration on the back-right of the keyboard that looks like a heat mark. So I cleaned up the laptop and screen and noticed that there are scratch marks on the hinges that hold the screen onto the laptop. This is supposed to be a new laptop. I double-checked the serial number with the one on the box just to make sure it was the same laptop, and it is. I then boot the laptop and went into device manager to see if there are any devices that are not recognized. For the most part things are good except for the touchpad, which is set to Microsoft PS/2 Mouse, and that driver might be the reason that the touch pad is erratic. The laptop is also extremely slow in installing and uninstalling software...on an i5 processor with 6GB of RAM. After checking Event Viewer I noticed an entry pointing to system firmware not being updated enough for the processor speed to be realized. I removed two separate, identical pieces of software from both laptops at the same time and the one that WAS NOT sent in for repair accomplished this at a much faster rate. At this point I regret buying an ASUS. A 50% average sucks when you are talking about computer products. Right now, I am 4+ hours waiting for this laptop to install updates. This is the second time I watched this laptop install this amount of updates. An hour and a half ago it was 111 updates, now it is 110. BTW I have Verizon Fios 50MB Internet connectivity, so it\\'s not the connection speed. Since I am a glutton for punishment I called ASUS tech support and asked if they could assist me in updating my laptop firmware. I figured it\\'s the least they could do since the \"repaired\" laptop came back without the latest firmware. After a few minutes the tech support rep stated that he couldn\\'t assist me, that I would need to visit their site and do it on my own. I will not buy another ASUS laptop if for any other reason than for their laughable tech support. I then called tech support back and asked that they assist me in updating the firmware, and gave them the Event Viewer details, and the next thing I know is I\\'m on the phone with a representative from Microsoft support. So I ask her for help and inform her of the background of my issue. She tells me that I need to see a local tech support person face to face. OMG I\\'m about to lose it at this point. So I call ASUS support back and I hear the phone pick up, then I hear people talking in the background, and then I am forwarded to a survey. After filling out the survey I call back again, and I get another survey. I call back again on my cell phone because at this point my home wireless phone battery is dead. I can\\'t remember the exact time but I do remember telling the technician that I\\'m going on 6+ hours with this laptop. The technician informed me that resetting the laptop will hopefully resolve the issues, and that I would lose everything with the reset. I\\'m fine with it, but I tell him that before I sent the laptop back for repair the first technician had me do the reset and it did nothing to resolve the issue. So here I am, 6+ hours into it already and I know the system restore is going to take hours. I stay up for it...its past 2:30AM and I can\\'t take it anymore. I get a few hours of sleep and wake up around 7AM and check on the reset. It looks like it finished but I am still seeing the same Event Viewer entries and experience the same system sluggishness. Maybe the Windows update is causing the slowness? No...I had the same exact laptop right next to this one and had no issue with sluggishness at all. Of course I didn\\'t see the Event Viewer entries in the other laptop. Windows is downloading updates so I let it download and run them. Windows reboots and hangs. I let the process go on for around 2 hours and then I cold boot. Windows is now screwed up, so I go and do another reset. It is now 1:55PM and I just gave my son this laptop because he has been patiently waiting to get his Christmas present. This laptop has issues. I bought this laptop brand new and it has never worked as it should out of the box...it has never worked as it should upon return from \"repair\"...and after resetting/reloading Windows not once but twice it is still having issues.

I also had the invoice copy of the purchased product and all other necessary documents. Instead of giving the product the service center person, Arun Kumar started abusing me stating that they cannot give the product even if i have the mail as proof. I spoke to the Asus Customer care and they too spoke to this guy to give the product to me but he still refused to give it. Instead i had to go the nearby police station to file a FIR stating that i had given the tablet for repair to the service center.

I explained to Mario the issue I was having and he patiently spent the better part of an hour walking me through the following:\\n\\n1. Step by step process to gain access to establishing a new sign in name and password.\\n\\n\\n2. Step by step process I need to follow if I needed access the site to make any changes in the future.\\n\\n3. Step by step process to delete my previous wi-fi set up in order to set up my new wi-fi. This was necessary because I attempted to name my new wi-fi set up the same as my previous one. Apparently that's a no no.\\n\\n4. I'm sure there's a few other things he helped me with, but I don't remember them at the moment.\\n\\nBut the most important thing I would like ASUS and his supervisor(s) know is that I believe Mario went far exceeded my expectations in helping me to set up my router. Throughout he was patient, courteous, professional, extremely knowledgeable and more than understanding of the frustration I was having. I can't sing his praises enough, but I do know this. Of the many customer service people I have had to speak with over the years, Mario is by far the best I've ever encountered. He is a definite asset to ASUS. If only more companies took the time to train their customer service personnel as ASUS obviously has, there'd be a lot more satisfied and repeat customers. In fact, I was even looking at an ASUS laptap today based simply on the positive experience I've had with your company.\\n\\nIn closing, please extend my heartfelt thanks to Mario2 M for a job well done. If ASUS has an outstanding customer service personnel awards, he has definitely deserves one.\\n\\nFeel free to contact me if you require additional information.\\n\\nRegards,\\n\\nJohn Bennett\", 'pos']\n",

She solved my computer problem that I have had for over two years now. I have spoken to over five or six different customer representatives in the past with this problem and no one was able to accomplish what Diandra did. I called today on another issue which was solved, but we got disconnected. Lucky for me because I called back and got Diandra who I can't believe fixed the one issue I had for years that no one else could manage to fix. Wow my lucky day. THANK YOU DIANADRA.
