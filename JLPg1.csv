"I am currently a plusnet broadband customer which I am happy to continue using. However as my contract has now ended and plusnet will not give me the "new customer" cashback incentive I am considering switching to John Lewis who are effectively still plusnet to my knowledge. In theory if I switch to John Lewis it should be the same service but I will get the current £75 black Friday deal as a new customer. Has anyone used both providers before? I am presuming it would be a fairly straightforward switch over considering they are effectively the same isp.", "1 month ago", "//div[@class='reviewBlock marked' and @id=review-3996]"
"Avoid. Avoid. Avoid. First John Lewis Broadband failed to process my order and I incurred increased charges from my old supplier. Then John Lewis Broadband never actually got around to pressing the 'on' button to connect my broadband when they were supposed to. Just when I thought I'd escaped these incompetents by moving to a new supplier when they jacked their prices up - it now turns out that John Lewis Broadband haven't actually disconnected my broadband and think they are still supplying me. Customer service don't know what they're doing and don't respond to online messages sent via my account. This is gong to effect my future relationship with Plusnet who I believe are the brains behind this outfit. Very damaging for their brand to be associated with this lot.", "7 months ago", "//div[@class='reviewBlock marked' and @id=review-3865]"
"They've taken my money and won't refund. I cancelled within 14 days. Since they lied to make a sale and it wasn't possible to get the service they said they would. In addition to this they never spelt my name, email etc correctly and were unable to correct this. They've taken my £29 and no one will give it back. i've spoken with over 10 'customer reps' each one less willing to help than the last. Many don't have a good grasp of english and don't want to help. A manager promised to call back but didn't.", "7 months ago", "//div[@class='reviewBlock marked' and @id=review-3858]"
"I ordered broadband with telephone for a recently rented property and paid £75.00 up front. I was offered three dates for an engineer to visit and the box would be delivered beforehand.
Needless to say I have not received the box and no engineer has arrived. I went online to my account and tried to make contact firstly via a mail box however I gave not received a response despite the promise of a reply within 24hrs. I also telephoned the customer service number and waited more than 3hours on hold before giving up.
John Lewis should stick to retail and not venture into areas they cannot deliver on.
I am at the stage now that I will never spend money on anything related to the John Lewis/Waitrose group in future.", "1 year ago", "//div[@class='reviewBlock marked' and @id=review-3551]"

"I ordered broadband 5 weeks ago still not heard anything. As I am writing this review I am on hold for the third day in a row to try and get through to cancel my order. At the moment I am into 103 minutes on hold. I am determined to get to speak to someone to cancel. I tried there online method which they say that they respond to in 24 hrs but that was 6 days ago. I don't normally write reviews but this service is RUBBISH and so is the music whilst your being ignored by the shocking staff.", "1 year ago", "//div[@class='reviewBlock marked' and @id=review-3462]"
