"What a terrible store in Layton Utah. Ordered a meal on the KFC Website for delivery. Order arrived and left by door dash. Upon inspection I was missing an entire bucket of chicken! When I called the store they said they couldn't do much with online orders and sent me to a 800# where I was on hold for 13 minutes for a partial refund. What a joke.",0, 0, 0,"9 hrs"

"the kfc in Winchester va on fox drive is the worst place I have ever tried to get food from. every time I go there they never have any food available and the workers have horrible customer service. I made an online order. I went and tried to pick up my order. they specifically said we don't have your order available cause we don't have any chicken in stock. and then the manager refuse to refund my money when they didn't even have any food!",0, 0, 0,"1 January at 16:13"

"My family and I ordered food at the drive thru. The employee that was taking the order let us know that it was going to take 15 minutes for our fish order and we could wait if we wanted. We said yes and waited longer than 15 minutes. When my husband went up to the door to look in he noticed at least two of the employees sitting on the counter. The reason the fish was going to take 15 minutes was so these “employees” could take a 15 minute break! The only reason they removed themselves from the counter was because a customer came inside to order! We don’t get this food often but now it will be even less as in not at all!",0, 0, 0,"4 December 2021 at 13:31"
