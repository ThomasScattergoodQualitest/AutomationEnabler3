A week or so later, the first game arrived in a very thin parcel which definitely only contained 1 game as there would not have been room for any more. I did not think this was unusual, as their own website stated that games may be dispatched separately as they may come from different stores. However, after a few more weeks when the second game did not arrive, I chased it with CEX (something I was only able to do via their website/email as they have no customer service telephone number to speak of). Initially a handler named Doris responded very helpfully that she would chase this up with the store responsible for dispatching the games, however, the subsequent emails quickly turned accusatory with phrases like As you claim you haven't received one game and the store has confirmed that both the items were sent in the same parcel.\\nThe handler seemed fixated on the condition of the original packaging that the first game came in, which i confirmed i had since thrown away as i expected the 2nd game to follow separately but was in perfectly fine condition. The handler was also extremely reluctant to escalate this to a manager, instead attempting to pacify me by stating she would pass it to the central team to investigate repeatedly. When I was finally able to deal with a manager (again by email only) an individual named Cheryl repeated the previous statements of Doris affirming that the store said they sent 2 and, if i don't have any pictures of the original packaging, then they can't help me any further. I feel the way I've been treated by this organisation is disgusting and I don't know how they expect me to prove that I didn't receive a game. Surely the onus is on them to prove that they sent the game, however, they have declined to provide any evidence of this or even explain what checks were made.\\nI have been repeatedly made to feel like a liar who is trying to get a free game and clearly this company are much more inclined to believe their employees over paying customers. This company has made querying this issue, and complaining, as difficult as they possibly can and it has had a serious impact on my mental health.

I returned it to the store who confirmed it wasn't working and they sent it to the repair team again, it was 'repaired' and returned. I got the store to test this before I left and it wasn't working. This is now in the complaints process, however the incompetence level is staggering, it is made worse by the fact I asked Customer services to 'double' check the repair (second time) before returning it. Which they assured me they had done. (Clearly not). The customer service team are adamant the unit is working and the store (same company by the way) have checked to evidence it is not working. I asked the matter to be referred as a customer complaint (but this was not done), I have re-initiated this as a complaint and the store and the repair centre are trying to work out if the unit is broken or not. (As a non-engineer) I have plugged it in and there is no on light to show it is on (my money is on it being broken). Cex responded to this saying it was being sorted (it wasn't) and I have had to liase between the shop and the repair team. An update Cex fans, the repair team claim it is fixed and returned it for the third time...you guessed it. Not working, shambles. I should point out that the third party repair company is Remedy Tech Centre Ltd. Final update, I purchased a new power lead at the Xbox worked. The Tech team returned it not work for a third time advising no repair possible. I have complained and now they have listed some (repairs) they claim so to justify taking my money. My compliant has been rejected. I only hope the Managing Director of CEX recognises the Customer service failings. This company are truly appalling.

Unfortunately this information is not available to customers in the form of photographic evidence, I suspect that the shop who bought it in just did a tick box job and wiped the computer over and no such checks were ever carried out. I was fuming as I was unable to prove that any of what I was told was accurate and correct, all I can say is that I am aware that Macs have liquid indicators on the logic board and they can slowly change colour with mild humidity over a long period of time. I took the computer to an independent mac repair specialist and on opening it they found NO sign of liquid damage, and the plastic clip fracture which was securing the battery I was told was a common issue with the heat which is generated in this component and not someone poking about.\\nThe repairer tried changing some of the chips on the board but this still failed to resolve the issue. We settled for a replacement logic board at the cost of £180. The computer is now fine.\\nI was going to take the company through the small claims court but I was sick to the back teeth with their sharp unverifiable get out of warranty claims practice and didn't want to push up my blood pressure dealing with them.\\nLooking back I should have insisted that the computer be opened up in front of me and show me where this damage was and along with the so called buy in inspection report but these checks are done in the shops own time while you are out of the way.\\nThe Mac engineer that fixed it for me told me that he had tried to sell a laptop to CEX that he had stripped and cleaned and checked that it was all OK. When he went back to check for their buying offer price they told him that a USB port was physically damaged and that the computer was not worth much. He knew that the computer was in perfect condition when he gave it to them but couldn't prove it. Why would you expect to need to have photographic evidence. I'll leave to conclusions up to you but I know who I believe.\\nI hope you Macbook has a long and happy life but be VERY VERY AWARE if you have a problem with it and expect some sort of warranty redress.\\nHave a look at the comments on the Internet about this company, you will find many people experiencing the same sort of sharp practice as I received.\\nI for one will NEVER NEVER NEVER have anything to do with this company again\\nOn posting this reply I tried to use the nickname Mr Unhappy but the system said it was already used .... what can I say!!!\\n”\", '1', 'Posted 1 year ago']\n",

In this, the missing package issue was noted and a customer support executive emailed me. They wanted the copy of the reverse of the calling card which was sent to them on 29 January.

They took my phone and raised no concern about its condition, however on my return they advised my phone had a crack which I was very surprised about as I make a habit of looking after my phones. Anyway as I could proved they had damage it, I agreed to go ahead and purchase the S10 + 5G. I took the phone to EE and purchased a new sim, but for some reason they struggled to get the phone to recognise the sim and advised me to take the phone to a Samsung store as there appeared to be something wrong. Samsung checked the phone out on their system and apparently It was not showing where it was made and had other details that Samsung were concerned about. I went back to CEX and explained to them what Samsung had discovered and asked for a refund however despite this they refused to refund my money which I had paid them a few hours earlier. I again went back to Samsung to obtain further details of their concerns and we discovered that the phone had been imported from outside the EU and tethered to a Korean network which meant the 5G wouldn't work in this country anyway. After almost 7 hours, reluctantly CEX refunded my money but did not make any offer to compensate me for my time.

Though the service wasn't the quickest and the products weren't always the cleanest (had to scrub a few keyboards), by and large it was a good transaction.\\nRecently however, I ordered another batch of a few mice and a couple of keyboards, we have them spare in the office for when new people join or old ones break down. Unfortunately, when we tested them (not immediately) the two keyboards were faulty, one had a key that fell off on first press and the other had several keys that didn't respond to pressing at all. Btw, the keyboards were category A and B, so meant to be in pretty good shape.\\nI emailed CEX and they told me that we could take them into a local store, they would be tested and we would be refunded if there was an issue - here's the important bit, there was no mention of a timescale (the terms on their site mention a 24 month warranty). Returning keyboards being fairly low priority for a business, we didn't end up taking the keyboards in for several weeks.\\nTaking the keyboards into the store (again, no meniton that the delay was a problem) they said the keyboards would have to be tested. We didn't hear anything for a while so we got in touch to ask what was going on - it turns out that the keyboards were broken, there were signs of wear and tear, so they wouldn't be able to refund us.\\nI was obviously quite surprised by this because we knew they were faulty - that was why we had taken them back. The insinuation was clear, we had somehow broken the keyboards since we received them. When I suggested this was a little ridiculous (over email) the only response I have been given is that we should have taken them in sooner.\\nThere is no mention of how much sooner. There is, as far as I can see, nothing in their t&cs about an exact timeframe either. They say there's nothing they can do.\\nThe takeaway - if you want to buy something from CEX, make sure you go to the shop and test the product then and there. As far as I can tell the 24 month warranty is completely useless because they can always argue that you took to long to lodge a complaint or that the fault is your own fault.

I went to cex Leeds crossgates to trade in my Nikon DSLR 7000 with 2 lenses and a battery grip, all in pristine condition GradeA one employee said, but the other 2 that was behind the counter said no its Grade B as it has 1 mark, (fingerprint smudge on screen that they even wiped off) I could even add photos to prove condition. I'm a photographer/videographer hobbyist and take real good care of my equipment. I even told them I wanted to trade as i wanted to purchase a Panasonic 4k camcorder they had online. I left without a sale and sold my Nikon online elsewhere. I contacted Cex online (customer services) explaned my case shown proof of my equipment and how I felt like they was trying to RIP me off and was issued a £10 evoucher as a sorry, I accepted that and was great full. I ordered the Panasonic 4k camcorder online as a Grade B, expecting it to be as my Nikon Grade B give or take the box you no. It arrived today it a terrible state, viewfinder was damaged, the wind proof microphone mesh was packed with mud like it had been dropped in mud, the rest of the body and charger looked like it had been sat on a dusty shelf for years. I took it to my local branch Leeds crossgates and asked the head man in there what condition he would sell it as to witch he replied 100% Grade C an asked what I payed for it as he was checking on his computer, I told him £335.00, and he then said its sorted I've issued you a full refund into your payment method, I never instructed or asked for a refund I simply asked him what Grade he would class it as, and how we could resolve it. I even asked him if he could of refunded the diference from Grade B to Grade C, his reply after changing something on the computerhe was on was we only Grade camcorders as Grade A or Grade B, clearly lieing about that as there are Grade C Camcorders on there site. I Shocked as to why he would even lie about it. He mentioned the DSLR I had wanted to sell and I told him I had contacted customer support and they said from pictures I sent they would have had no issues as to list my Nikon as a Grade A, to witch he replyed, I don't care what some customer service employee said sat over in India behind a desk without a clue what hes doing. I asked why the remark about India, and his reply was that's where the idiots are. I was shocked even a couple of other customers laughed in shock. I felt uncomfortable been spoke to like that about a product I had purchased, this whole experience as left me wanting to take it further. I'm now unable to purchase a camera to film this weekend motorsport as my money's on hold with PayPal. I would give this no stars if I could.

Purchases are typically delivered within two working days [occassionaly 1 working day, occassionally three working days]. Where I feel CEX could improve is that their listings do not contain enough information & some are really pretty slovenly. This can result in thinking you are buying one edition only to have another one delivered instead. I recently ordered a particular BD based on the picture and [scanty] item info. The item that turned up was the same film but a different edition to the one pictured in the listing. Although it is easy to return items to CEX & get a refund, if they took a little more time in describing items more acurately it would save their customer dissappointment and the trouble of queueing up to resolve the matter. That said, the prices I sometimes pay for specialist films are substantially below what I would pay other well-known sites. The other related problem is that when I returned the item in question to my local branch it reappeared on the CEX site as again available from the store, but still with the same misleading picture and description. Someone else is going to buy it and will most likely return it as I did. Overall the service I get from CEX online is excellent.\\n”\", '5', 'Posted 2 years ago']\n",

Upon arriving in the shop, I saw within seconds that the laptop had not even been charged! This was strange as I had handed it in fully charged. After leaving the laptop to charge for an hour, they said there was nothing they could do as they have been trying to switch it on for days but nothing happened. What was particularly ridiculous was that they were in fact able to set up the laptop enough put a brand new password on it... I am greatly convinced that they took my laptop for parts and then claimed it was already broken when I gave it in, a clear lie. I wouldn't want this to happen to anyone else as now I can't even try to sell the laptop elsewhere as it is broken. Definitely use a more reliable shop or site!\\n”\", '1', 'Posted 2 years ago']\n",

Even a 3rd party! And that the pictures shown don't represent what I'm really buying. The only reason I know this is because I live not to far from a Cex so I emailed them asking them if I could swap the controller I'd reserved for the minecraft and was given a link to there T&C and told no and that I should take it from my kids and return it. They didn't ask what controller I'd been given and if they did they might have released it cost more then the minecraft one I wanted and was expecting when buy. Very disappointed and feel cheated.

Nothing was heard from them apart from the automatically generated email (stating delivery would take place between 3-5 working days) until Thursday. The email stated the item had been dispatched and gave me a UPS tracking number. The tracking number did not work at all and on Friday morning I contacted customer service by email about this issue. I also later contacted them by Facebook messenger as they hadn't responded to my email. It's not possible to phone CEX customer service, only email, Facebook & Twitter and they don't respond quickly to any of those either. I was then informed that the store hadn't shipped my item as reported and they would do so today (Friday). It would definitely go out today. I was given a new tracking number and using this I found that the item hadn't shipped on Friday. Saturday morning I contacted them again. After a long wait I was informed the item now wouldn't ship until Monday. No apologies. The item now won't arrive for a further 5 days, making the total shipping time 10 days! No apologies from anyone. I was just thanked for my understanding. I requested to pick up the item from the store but was told I could not for security reasons. Dont understand what security risks there are if i bring the appropriate ID. So I asked if I could cancel the order, get a refund of my in store voucher and buy one myself from another store. I was told this would take 3 working days to process! Now I am between a rock and a hard place as I have no quick solution to getting my voucher or my laptop. Customer service take ages to respond to communications and are unwilling to do anything quickly to resolve the situation. Contacting CS by electronic means is not acceptable. We really need a phone number to call in situations like this, but CEX don't want to give us one. Terrible service. Avoid buying on line from them at all costs.\\n”\", '1', 'Posted 3 years ago']\n",
