I made an online order. I went and tried to pick up my order. they specifically said we don't have your order available cause we don't have any chicken in stock. and then the manager refuse to refund my money when they didn't even have any food!\n",
      "Their app is terrible their customer service is non-existent. They are only out for the money not to provide a decent meal! Called their 1 800 number no answer after waiting get sent to a voice mail Great Customer Service!\n",
