      "['9/20/15 7:03AM', 'Yesterday we noticed that our Netflix account of over ten years was compromised. Someone had deleted all the non primary profiles, renamed my primary profile and added two new profiles. The names on the new profiles were Evar, Tulva and Sel. Of course I immediately changed my password and called customer service. I explained that my family\\'s profiles were deleted after someone hacked my account and asked them to restore the original profiles so that we could retain over ten years worth of activity on these profiles. I was told that Netflix doesn\\'t have this capability. This is a multi million dollar if not billion dollar a year company and they are telling me they don\\'t back up user data. I also noticed that even though I had changed my password and checked the \"sign off all devices\" box that all of our other devices were still able to go into Netflix, watch movies and most disquieting of all, change the password and/or email address on my account. This was an Ipad, two Iphones, and Android phone and the PC in my living room. When I asked the customer support rep why this was I was told \"it takes 8 hours for the signal to be distributed to these other devices\". I questioned the tech as to why it takes something that travels the speed of light 8 hours to kick out other devices on my account. Pointing out that an 8 hour window is plenty of time for anyone that hacked my account to continue to make changes to it, including my password and email address and that this doesn\\'t exactly instill much confidence in me the customer. At last I requested to speak to a supervisor. After explaining my issues to the supervisor and being told that I would be put on hold while he looked into my problems, I listened to the same songs for over five minutes before being transferred to a survey asking me if I was satisfied with the service I received. Then the robot voice said \"thank you, goodbye\" and the call ended. I called back, by this time it was discovered that even though I had changed the name on the primary profile from \"Evar\" to my own name, the Netflix navigation window was still referring to me as \"Evar\" as in \"Top Picks for Evar\" etc. When I called back I spoke with the same support rep I had in the first place and asked for him to put me through to his supervisor again. By the way the support rep was named \"Steven\" and his supervisor was named \"Al\" or \"Allen\". Again I was cut off and called back a third time. Got a support rep named \"Kevin\" this time and asked to speak to a Manager. Kevin asked me to provide details so he could escalate the call. After I gave him details he attempted to trouble shoot with me. I reminded him that he asked for details and that I gave them and wish to speak with his Manager. He put me on hold and ten minutes later I was talking to another Supervisor. I explained my issues again to this supervisor (for the fourth time now) and was told that it takes 8 hours for the system to kick out the other devices on my account. Again I insisted that this was an outrageous window of opportunity for hackers to continue to run rampant with my account. Meanwhile my wife and daughter were still on their devices, using all the original log in information to watch movies AND had access to the \"change password\" and \"change email\" forms on my account. My \"current\" password showing up on their devices as a series of dots, already filled in and the form just waiting for a \"new password\" to be added and underneath confirmed. I was again told that it will take 8 hours for the new log in information to work and for all devices to be booted out. I was also informed it would take 24 hours for my personal information on my primary profile to reflect my own name and not \"Evar\" on the navigation page.\\n\\nSo, to recap.\\n\\n1. Lost four profiles worth of data (watched, rated etc. ) Netflix has no backups or ways to restore that. Big problem.\\n\\n2. After my account was compromised by hackers it will take 8 hours to purge them from my account even after changing my password and email address. Enormous Problem. There is no excuse in the 21st century for such a delay.\\n\\n3. I was hung up on not once but twice by Netflix before my issues were resolved.', 'neg']\n",

In business, you need to be relational and realize that reputation is everything. These are real consumers who used your business in honest ways. We continue to see the fallout of US business because the words honesty and customer service are gone. I wish you well in your future with Netflix and would recommend searching/goggling all of the social media remarks and turning the stories into positive endings. I believe that all of the below stories of charging accounts wrongly occured within the time frame of your companies growing pains. It is our honest money that your company dishonestly took.\\n\\nI found the following clip from an article Seeing RED published in Vanity Fair February 2012 interesting. This is a clip taken from the article written by Wiliam D Cohan.\\n\\n\\nSince this was not rocket science, it took about a nano-second for Netflix\\'s 24 million or so customers to realize that they were being hit with a 60 percent price increase; what had once cost $10 a month would now cost $16. Even though the price to see a first-run movie in a theater on the nation\\'s two coasts averages around $13 per ticket, the social networks and the blogosphere lit up with such instant fury you might have thought Hastings had dropped a nuclear device on his customers. Greg Heitzmann, a University of Missouri graduate, was typical of the nearly 13,000 people who went on the Netflix Blog to express their anger: \"To say the least, I am shocked and appalled at your recent behavior,\" Heitzmann wrote. \"Your nominal price increase, while unexpected, does not deter my loyalty. However, your mouthpiece Jessie Becker\\'s presentation of this upcharge-as an added choice for my own benefit-insults my intelligence and reveals the breadth of your arrogance. Had I been treated like an adult and informed of these changes in a straightforward, honest manner, perhaps we could rekindle our spark. Unfortunately, this course of action is no longer available; your condescending and manipulative tone has irreparably ruined our relationship.\" Heitzmann canceled his subscription. He was not alone. More than 800,000 Netflix subscribers dropped the service within months of the July announcement.\\n\\nAs customers continued to flee, Hastings leapt into the fray to try to explain. \"I messed up,\" he wrote on the Netflix Blog on September 18. \"I owe everyone an explanation. It is clear from the feedback over the past two months that many members felt we lacked respect and humility in the way we announced the separation of DVD and streaming, and the price changes. That was certainly not our intent, and I offer my sincere apology.\"\\n\\n\"We weren\\'t doing the price change to raise profits or something,\" he elaborated to me. \"We were doing it because we were so focused on becoming the streaming company and the global streaming company that we always wanted to be, and always have wanted to be.\" He said that he sees the future of Netflix similarly to how big telephone companies see their futures in wireless, rather than in landline, phones. \"Most companies that are great at something-like AOL dialup or Borders bookstores-do not become great at new things people want (streaming for us) because they are afraid to hurt their initial business,\" he wrote on the blog.\\nTaken from an article found by Googling Netflix CEO\\n\\nHastings took the blame for the failure to communicate better with customers. \"In hindsight, I slid into arrogance based upon past success,\" he wrote. \"But now I see that given the huge changes we have been recently making, I should have personally given a full justification to our members of why we are separating DVD and streaming, and charging for both. It wouldn\\'t have changed the price increase, but it would have been the right thing to do.\"\\n\\n\\nHere is my story. My husband asked me about the Net Flex charges coming out of our checking account. I told him that after our last conversation about \"budget cuts\" I called to cancel the account with Net Flex via phone because the charges were going to double with the new pricing Netflix announced. Of course, Net Flex shows no record of this~ I went back into my archived emails and have not received any marketing materials via mail or email since the date of closing my account in 2012 So honestly,I considered this account closed. They continued to charge my account every month. Spoke to Home Office today and all they can do is say sorry and refund me 1 month. I asked politely to reconsider? look at my account do you see any activity? any emails to me? Even meet me half way? The answer reluctantly was sorry we don\\'t but that is all we can do.\\n\\nI found these too. Looks like I am not the only one. Customer service and long term profitability all rely on one thing~\\nHONESTY\\n\\nI have been being charged twice every month on my credit card for Netflix service for 2 years now, ever since going to streaming instead of CDs. I called them and they said they only show that I was being charged once a month and said they searched their entire system and they have no other charges under my number. I called the credit card company and they investigated with me. They found that it had been going on since Jan. of 2012. This is now Jan. 2014. I didn\\'t realize it had been that long. I procrastinated on this for a few months but they refuse to admit that they are double charging us. I cancelled that card number out of Netflix and we\\'re still getting charged. I am out $191 so far, need to see if it comes through again this month. If someone decided to do a class action suit, I\\'m in as long as I don\\'t have to lay out any more money.\\n\\nNetflix has been double billing me for months (after I requested that the double billing be remedied). They were unable to find my double accounts via my name and had to check via the credit card #. They could have done this back in March when I called, but did not. They are now waffling about whether or not I will get a refund for anything else but last month\\'s double billing. I will definitely cancel my membership if the refund is not for the complete amount. Especially since I\\'ve called about this problem already. This is not the way to keep customers.\\n\\n\\n\\nNetflix over charged me for over a year by charging 2 different accounts even though one had no account activity on it. Once I finally realized it, I complained and was told they would only refund 2 months\\' worth of charges on one of the accounts. I told them to close the accounts so I would not be charged any more. After some time I wanted to sign up for Netflix to watch a show that is only available on cable which I don\\'t have and Netflix. When I tried to sign up, I was told a permanent block was put on my debit card and my account was listed as having fraudulent activity. There was no fraudulent activity except on Netflix\\'s account and I never told them to put a hold on my card. They refuse to take the block off of my card or take the fraud label off of the account. I suppose so they can try to justify overcharging me for so long.\\n\\nThe only people that will communicate with you are first level lackeys that keep repeating the same thing over and over. This company has horrible practices, horrible customer service, and no one who is willing to take responsibility for any errors they make. I understand I am just one of many who have been overcharged by this sham of a company and also not able to find someone who is willing to fix the problem.

There is absolutely no reason to remove the kilobyte (OR LESS) of storage space this information constitutes. Now 5 years of inactivity I can understand. Nobody wants a database that clogged.

When I asked what the email had been switched to, I was told that I was not allowed to have that information (from my own account) per company policy, and was then passed off to her manager, supposedly Mike (with no last name -1010146) who then accused me of being the person who hacked my account (even though I had just verified my own credit info to get the account switched back) and suggested that giving me that email would incur some sort of (imaginary) liability onto them or Netflix, and told me it probably wasn't a valid email address anyway (he did a lot of BS lying), even though (as I told him), there is no possible way that the hacker could have used a fake email, as for them to have logged in and changed everything as they did, they would have had to use the password reset that was emailed to that address (A Netflix Customer Service Rep doesn't know this? Hmmm...). Instead of giving me the information I asked for (and there was no legitimate reason for him not to) he just made up one obvious lie after another to the point I felt like screaming. On top of this, once I had logged into my account (and changed the language setting back to English), I found that my plan had been upped to the premium package along with the DVD rental, and the service rep hadn't even bothered to tell me that! If I hadn't looked, I would have just been surprised when I got a bigger bill charged to my account. Unfortunately, the hacker hadn't yet changed the address to where the DVDs were set to go yet, so I wasn't able to find out who they were that way either. Yet I'll probably still get a bigger bill this month because of the change, and the fact that I have no intention of dialing customer support again.

       "  'Yesterday we noticed that our Netflix account of over ten years was compromised. Someone had deleted all the non primary profiles, renamed my primary profile and added two new profiles. The names on the new profiles were Evar, Tulva and Sel. Of course I immediately changed my password and called customer service. I explained that my family\\'s profiles were deleted after someone hacked my account and asked them to restore the original profiles so that we could retain over ten years worth of activity on these profiles. I was told that Netflix doesn\\'t have this capability. This is a multi million dollar if not billion dollar a year company and they are telling me they don\\'t back up user data. I also noticed that even though I had changed my password and checked the \"sign off all devices\" box that all of our other devices were still able to go into Netflix, watch movies and most disquieting of all, change the password and/or email address on my account. This was an Ipad, two Iphones, and Android phone and the PC in my living room. When I asked the customer support rep why this was I was told \"it takes 8 hours for the signal to be distributed to these other devices\". I questioned the tech as to why it takes something that travels the speed of light 8 hours to kick out other devices on my account. Pointing out that an 8 hour window is plenty of time for anyone that hacked my account to continue to make changes to it, including my password and email address and that this doesn\\'t exactly instill much confidence in me the customer. At last I requested to speak to a supervisor. After explaining my issues to the supervisor and being told that I would be put on hold while he looked into my problems, I listened to the same songs for over five minutes before being transferred to a survey asking me if I was satisfied with the service I received. Then the robot voice said \"thank you, goodbye\" and the call ended. I called back, by this time it was discovered that even though I had changed the name on the primary profile from \"Evar\" to my own name, the Netflix navigation window was still referring to me as \"Evar\" as in \"Top Picks for Evar\" etc. When I called back I spoke with the same support rep I had in the first place and asked for him to put me through to his supervisor again. By the way the support rep was named \"Steven\" and his supervisor was named \"Al\" or \"Allen\". Again I was cut off and called back a third time. Got a support rep named \"Kevin\" this time and asked to speak to a Manager. Kevin asked me to provide details so he could escalate the call. After I gave him details he attempted to trouble shoot with me. I reminded him that he asked for details and that I gave them and wish to speak with his Manager. He put me on hold and ten minutes later I was talking to another Supervisor. I explained my issues again to this supervisor (for the fourth time now) and was told that it takes 8 hours for the system to kick out the other devices on my account. Again I insisted that this was an outrageous window of opportunity for hackers to continue to run rampant with my account. Meanwhile my wife and daughter were still on their devices, using all the original log in information to watch movies AND had access to the \"change password\" and \"change email\" forms on my account. My \"current\" password showing up on their devices as a series of dots, already filled in and the form just waiting for a \"new password\" to be added and underneath confirmed. I was again told that it will take 8 hours for the new log in information to work and for all devices to be booted out. I was also informed it would take 24 hours for my personal information on my primary profile to reflect my own name and not \"Evar\" on the navigation page.\\n\\nSo, to recap.\\n\\n1. Lost four profiles worth of data (watched, rated etc. ) Netflix has no backups or ways to restore that. Big problem.\\n\\n2. After my account was compromised by hackers it will take 8 hours to purge them from my account even after changing my password and email address. Enormous Problem. There is no excuse in the 21st century for such a delay.\\n\\n3. I was hung up on not once but twice by Netflix before my issues were resolved.',\n",

The first 2 times I was understanding, but last week there was an issue with both the DVD I had and Netflix streaming. Wow, I pay for services I can\\'t use? That\\'s not right! I called customer service for each department, here are my pitiful experiences:\\n\\nFirst, DVD customer service is NOT open after 8pm. Which is annoying because I don\\'t settle in to watch my movies until after work, dinner, and dishes, at least 9pm. Now I have to call back in the morning, when I don\\'t have time! Secondly, I\\'ve been told that the real problem is not the DVD disk, but it\\'s my DVD BlueRay player. Really? Nothing is wrong with my BlueRay player. 2 out of 3 replacements played just fine, but 2 copies of Mission a Impossible III played for 25 to 30 minutes, then started skipping all over the place. Customer service reps were generally unhelpful, didn\\'t ease my frustration and when I said \"cancel my service,\" they said \"ok.\" Nothing to make things right (except to send me more broken disks), nothing to try to keep me satisfied, nothing to keep me as a customer. Wow! This is NOT the company Reed Hastings founded as I know it. What has happened?\\n\\nStreaming services were also down during the time my DVDs wouldn\\'t work. One rep one night told me they were having issues, that \"stuff\" happened and nothing they could do; I would just have to check back. The next night, still no streaming services. I called again. This rep told me they weren\\'t having issues, it was my DVD player and it needed to be updated and reset to factory default settings. Umm, my player was already updated and I don\\'t know how to \"reset to factory settings.\" He told me to call the manufacturer. Again, no real help. And no recourse. I didn\\'t do anything and a few days later I tried streaming services again - guess what? It was working. Now I\\'m feeling I was deceived. I told Netflix to cancel my streaming services too.

Netflix has a help page about my particular problem, and I had already gone through all the fixes in the article. None of them fixed my problem, so I contacted Netflix through their online chat option. I talked to some guy named Ricardo who assured me that he was \"the man for the job.\" After I explained the problem and what I had done to try to fix it, he suggested that I try all the steps in the article (the things that I had done before) again and assured me that would fix the problem this time. He said that if I continued to have problems, I could contact customer service again but that I definitely wouldn\\'t need to do that. Naturally, after I went through all the steps again, it still wasn\\'t working. My second attempt at customer service (with another guy who had trouble understanding what the problem was) was even less successful. I really have no choice but to cancel Netflix since I can\\'t play it the way I had been playing it for the last year and a half.

We continue to see the fallout of US business because the words honesty and customer service are gone. I wish you well in your future with Netflix and would recommend searching/goggling all of the social media remarks and turning the stories into positive endings.

It is our honest money that your company dishonestly took.\\n\\nI found the following clip from an article Seeing RED published in Vanity Fair February 2012 interesting. This is a clip taken from the article written by Wiliam D Cohan.\\n\\n\\nSince this was not rocket science, it took about a nano-second for Netflix\\'s 24 million or so customers to realize that they were being hit with a 60 percent price increase; what had once cost $10 a month would now cost $16. Even though the price to see a first-run movie in a theater on the nation\\'s two coasts averages around $13 per ticket, the social networks and the blogosphere lit up with such instant fury you might have thought Hastings had dropped a nuclear device on his customers. Greg Heitzmann, a University of Missouri graduate, was typical of the nearly 13,000 people who went on the Netflix Blog to express their anger: \"To say the least, I am shocked and appalled at your recent behavior,\" Heitzmann wrote. \"Your nominal price increase, while unexpected, does not deter my loyalty. However, your mouthpiece Jessie Becker\\'s presentation of this upcharge-as an added choice for my own benefit-insults my intelligence and reveals the breadth of your arrogance. Had I been treated like an adult and informed of these changes in a straightforward, honest manner, perhaps we could rekindle our spark. Unfortunately, this course of action is no longer available; your condescending and manipulative tone has irreparably ruined our relationship.\" Heitzmann canceled his subscription. He was not alone. More than 800,000 Netflix subscribers dropped the service within months of the July announcement.\\n\\nAs customers continued to flee, Hastings leapt into the fray to try to explain. \"I messed up,\" he wrote on the Netflix Blog on September 18. \"I owe everyone an explanation. It is clear from the feedback over the past two months that many members felt we lacked respect and humility in the way we announced the separation of DVD and streaming, and the price changes. That was certainly not our intent, and I offer my sincere apology.\"\\n\\n\"We weren\\'t doing the price change to raise profits or something,\" he elaborated to me. \"We were doing it because we were so focused on becoming the streaming company and the global streaming company that we always wanted to be, and always have wanted to be.\" He said that he sees the future of Netflix similarly to how big telephone companies see their futures in wireless, rather than in landline, phones. \"Most companies that are great at something-like AOL dialup or Borders bookstores-do not become great at new things people want (streaming for us) because they are afraid to hurt their initial business,\" he wrote on the blog.\\nTaken from an article found by Googling Netflix CEO\\n\\nHastings took the blame for the failure to communicate better with customers. \"In hindsight, I slid into arrogance based upon past success,\" he wrote. \"But now I see that given the huge changes we have been recently making, I should have personally given a full justification to our members of why we are separating DVD and streaming, and charging for both. It wouldn\\'t have changed the price increase, but it would have been the right thing to do.\"\\n\\n\\nHere is my story. My husband asked me about the Net Flex charges coming out of our checking account. I told him that after our last conversation about \"budget cuts\" I called to cancel the account with Net Flex via phone because the charges were going to double with the new pricing Netflix announced. Of course, Net Flex shows no record of this~ I went back into my archived emails and have not received any marketing materials via mail or email since the date of closing my account in 2012 So honestly,I considered this account closed. They continued to charge my account every month. Spoke to Home Office today and all they can do is say sorry and refund me 1 month. I asked politely to reconsider? look at my account do you see any activity? any emails to me? Even meet me half way? The answer reluctantly was sorry we don\\'t but that is all we can do.\\n\\nI found these too. Looks like I am not the only one. Customer service and long term profitability all rely on one thing~\\nHONESTY\\n\\nI have been being charged twice every month on my credit card for Netflix service for 2 years now, ever since going to streaming instead of CDs. I called them and they said they only show that I was being charged once a month and said they searched their entire system and they have no other charges under my number. I called the credit card company and they investigated with me. They found that it had been going on since Jan. of 2012. This is now Jan. 2014. I didn\\'t realize it had been that long. I procrastinated on this for a few months but they refuse to admit that they are double charging us. I cancelled that card number out of Netflix and we\\'re still getting charged. I am out $191 so far, need to see if it comes through again this month. If someone decided to do a class action suit, I\\'m in as long as I don\\'t have to lay out any more money.\\n\\nNetflix has been double billing me for months (after I requested that the double billing be remedied). They were unable to find my double accounts via my name and had to check via the credit card #. They could have done this back in March when I called, but did not. They are now waffling about whether or not I will get a refund for anything else but last month\\'s double billing. I will definitely cancel my membership if the refund is not for the complete amount. Especially since I\\'ve called about this problem already. This is not the way to keep customers.\\n\\n\\n\\nNetflix over charged me for over a year by charging 2 different accounts even though one had no account activity on it. Once I finally realized it, I complained and was told they would only refund 2 months\\' worth of charges on one of the accounts. I told them to close the accounts so I would not be charged any more. After some time I wanted to sign up for Netflix to watch a show that is only available on cable which I don\\'t have and Netflix. When I tried to sign up, I was told a permanent block was put on my debit card and my account was listed as having fraudulent activity. There was no fraudulent activity except on Netflix\\'s account and I never told them to put a hold on my card. They refuse to take the block off of my card or take the fraud label off of the account. I suppose so they can try to justify overcharging me for so long.\\n\\nThe only people that will communicate with you are first level lackeys that keep repeating the same thing over and over. This company has horrible practices, horrible customer service, and no one who is willing to take responsibility for any errors they make. I understand I am just one of many who have been overcharged by this sham of a company and also not able to find someone who is willing to fix the problem. There\\'s needs to be some oversight and investigation into Netflix.',\n",

I never have any problem cancel with netflix or blockbuster.then i start using the so call red boxes, they are very convinience yeah but they olso have negative side too, like you got people waiting behind you and you cant take your time selecting the movie that you really want to wacth and sometimes they run out,when you return movies the box is full so you have to wait untill some one rent a movie for you to return your movie. now you see what i mean it is always something.\\n\\nOk lets compare:\\nBlockbuster: in stores $3.00/$4.00 or more per movie for 5 nigths. online $12.99 minimum a month +.99 rental per new releases.\\n\\nRed Boxes: $1.25/$1.50 per movie per night...sometimes not enouth titles for every ones so you have to go to a diferent location.\\n\\nNetflix: $8.99 per month unlimited + one movie in the mail,unlimited streaming video 24/7/365 days.up to six divices like : Laptops,PC,ps3 wii,ipad,iphones,itouch,Htc Windows 7 Phones and next the epad tablet by android and any streaming player boxes. netflix have others plans prices too.\\n\\nto be honest netflix is the best thing that happeng online and to our economy.\\n\\npeople just do the math!\\n..the video quality is like dvd quality\\nwhy buy movies when you have your own video club online more then 90,000 titles to choose from,no more storage,no more damage dvd's, no more stolen or lost dvd's and no more trips to video clubs and if you have a streaming player box you can take it with you any where they have high speed wi-fi or internet connection.\\n\\nthere's so much to learn about netflix in the good way.\\njust read about it,learned,subscribe,enjoy...\\n\\nNetflix you're the best, A 10+++.\\n\\nsincerely,\\nRaul Betancourt\",\n",
